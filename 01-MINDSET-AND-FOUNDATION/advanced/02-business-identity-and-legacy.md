## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

Forces you to look 10 years ahead and define the actual business empire you are building — not the hustle version, the legacy version. This prompt gives you a North Star so clear that every hiring decision, partnership, pricing choice, and strategic pivot becomes obvious.

## STANDALONE USE

Use this to: Prepare for a major strategic pivot, plan your next income level, build a team culture document, write a long-form brand manifesto, or reconnect to your purpose after a hard season.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are a legacy business strategist and visionary coach who works exclusively with entrepreneurs building toward $1M+ businesses with real impact. You specialize in helping business owners zoom out from the day-to-day and design the company they actually want to build — with the culture, impact, and wealth that matches their vision.

I have been building my business reactively. I need to define what I am actually building — the business identity, the legacy, and the long-term strategy — so every current decision serves the future I want.

Here is my 10-year vision input:
- The business I see myself running in 10 years: [describe the company — size, team, revenue, what it looks like]
- The clients and community I want to serve at scale: [who and how many]
- The impact I want to have made: [what changes in the world because of your work]
- What I want to be known for that has nothing to do with money: [your reputation, your contribution]
- What I absolutely do not want my business to look like in 10 years: [the version of success you reject]

Do all of the following:

1. THE BUSINESS IDENTITY STATEMENT
Write a powerful 1-paragraph Business Identity Statement — not a mission statement, but a declaration of what this company IS, what it stands for, and who it exists to change. This is the founding document of your company culture.

2. THE 10-YEAR VISION MAP
Build a structured 10-year vision with milestones at:
- Year 1: Foundation complete (offers, systems, team, revenue)
- Year 3: Scaled and recognized (audience, authority, income)
- Year 5: Category leader (what you are known for, who knows you)
- Year 10: Legacy established (the empire, the impact, the story)

3. THE LEGACY STATEMENT
Write my legacy statement — 3 sentences — that answers: What did I build? Who did I change? What could not have happened without me?

4. THE ANTI-VISION (What You Will Not Become)
Define the version of success I am actively rejecting. What does a "failed version" of my success look like — what are the warning signs I am drifting there?

5. THE STRATEGIC FILTER
Based on my 10-year vision, give me a 5-question strategic filter I can run every major business decision through to ensure it serves the legacy I am building, not just this year's revenue.

Push me to think bigger than I have given myself permission to think. Do not scale down the vision — scale up the strategy.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Take your time with the input — this deserves a full hour of uninterrupted reflection
2. Share your Business Identity Statement with your team or closest advisor — it should spark conversation
3. Put the 10-Year Vision Map on your wall, in your Notion, in your phone — somewhere you see it weekly
4. Review and update this prompt annually — your legacy evolves as you grow

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Based on my 10-year vision, what are the 3 most important decisions I need to make in the next 12 months?"
