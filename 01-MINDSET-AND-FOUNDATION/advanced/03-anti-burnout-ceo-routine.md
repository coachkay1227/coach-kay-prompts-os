## THE PROMPT

```
You are a peak performance coach and productivity systems architect who works with high-achieving entrepreneurs doing $10K-$100K per month. You understand that at scale, the system IS the strategy — and you specialize in designing CEO operating systems that prevent burnout while accelerating growth.

I am building a business that is growing, but my schedule is chaos. I am reactive, scattered, and dangerously close to burning out. I need a CEO operating system — not a to-do list, a real system.

Here is my current situation:
- My current revenue and business stage: [monthly revenue, team size, number of active clients]
- My top 3 revenue-generating activities: [the specific things that directly make you money]
- My top 3 energy drains right now: [tasks, meetings, decisions that exhaust you]
- My peak energy time of day: [when you are sharpest — morning, afternoon, evening]
- My non-negotiables for life balance: [family time, health, rest — what must be protected]

Do all of the following:

1. CEO TIME AUDIT
Analyze my current situation and categorize my work into:
- CEO Activities (vision, strategy, high-value decisions)
- Operator Activities (client work, content, sales)
- Manager Activities (team oversight, systems, admin)
- Worker Activities (tasks any capable person could do)
Tell me what percentage of my time should be in each category at my current stage.

2. THE IDEAL WEEK DESIGN
Design my ideal weekly schedule based on:
- My peak energy time gets CEO and high-leverage activities
- Deep work blocks protected from interruptions
- Specific time for client delivery, content, and sales
- Recovery and integration built in (not optional)
Show this as a day-by-day schedule with time blocks.

3. THE DELEGATION MAP
List the top 10 tasks I should stop doing myself in the next 90 days. For each:
- Why it is a delegation (not a CEO activity)
- Who or what should handle it (VA, tool, contractor, team member)
- What it costs to delegate vs. what it frees you to create

4. THE ENERGY PROTECTION PROTOCOL
Design 5 non-negotiable energy protection rules for my business:
- Email and message response rules
- Meeting limits and batching strategy
- Decision fatigue reduction systems
- Recovery rituals that are business assets, not luxuries

5. THE BURNOUT EARLY WARNING SYSTEM
Give me 7 specific warning signs that I am approaching burnout — before it happens — and the immediate circuit-breaker action for each one.

Build this around a CEO who is building to $1M, not just surviving.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Be brutally honest about your energy drains — most entrepreneurs lie to themselves about this
2. Block your Ideal Week into your calendar BEFORE your next week starts — protect it like client appointments
3. Start the Delegation Map immediately — even one delegation per week creates massive compounding
4. Review the Burnout Warning Signs with your partner, coach, or close friend who can flag them for you

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "I have [number] hours per week and [team size]. Redesign the ideal week specifically for this constraint."
- "I need to delegate [specific task type]. Write a hiring brief and onboarding checklist for this role."
- "Create a weekly CEO check-in ritual that reviews my top metrics and resets my priorities in 15 minutes."
