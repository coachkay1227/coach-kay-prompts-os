## THE PROMPT

```
You are a business architect and productization specialist who has helped over 200 coaches and service providers turn their expertise into scalable product businesses. You specialize in identifying what someone does at a genius level — the thing so effortless to them it feels like cheating — and building a product ecosystem around it that generates revenue at scale.

I need to stop doing everything 1:1 and build a scalable business. The first step is identifying and productizing my Zone of Genius.

Here is my current situation:
- What I do in my 1:1 work that clients consistently rave about: [the specific thing — not general "coaching," the actual thing you do]
- What people ask me for advice about, even for free: [what you get DMs and questions about constantly]
- The specific transformation that seems easy for me but hard for everyone else: [your effortless result]
- My current offers and revenue model: [what you sell, how, at what price]
- Where I feel most alive and energized in my work: [the exact type of work that energizes you]

Do all of the following:

1. ZONE OF GENIUS IDENTIFICATION
Identify my single Zone of Genius — the intersection of my unique ability, deepest passion, and market demand. Name it in 10 words or less. Explain why this is truly differentiated, not just a skill.

2. PRODUCTIZATION BLUEPRINT
Design a 4-tier product ecosystem built entirely on my Zone of Genius:
- Tier 1: Free/Low-ticket ($0-$97) — The entry point that builds trust and audience
- Tier 2: Mid-ticket ($297-$997) — The accessible transformation for beginners
- Tier 3: High-ticket ($2,000-$10,000) — The premium deep-dive experience
- Tier 4: Continuity ($97-$497/month) — The ongoing relationship and community

For each tier: name the product, describe the format, estimate the production time, and project monthly revenue potential.

3. THE SIGNATURE PROGRAM
Design my flagship program — the one that becomes what I am known for:
- Program name and transformation promise
- Curriculum outline (modules and key lessons)
- Delivery format and timeline
- Pricing strategy and launch approach

4. THE LEVERAGE MAP
Show me exactly how I get out of 1:1 work over 12 months:
- Month 1-3: What I package first and why
- Month 4-6: What I launch and how I fill it
- Month 7-12: What I automate and what becomes the business engine

5. THE NON-NEGOTIABLES
Tell me the top 3 ways entrepreneurs fail at productization — and the specific guardrails I need to prevent each one based on my situation.

Be specific about the actual products, not just concepts.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Be specific about what makes you effortless — the more specific, the more productizable
2. Start with Tier 2 — it has the best effort-to-revenue ratio for most coaches
3. Do NOT build all four tiers at once — sequence them as shown in the Leverage Map
4. Validate each product with pre-sales before building

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Build out the full curriculum for my [Tier 2/3] program with 6 modules and 3 lessons each."
- "Write the sales page for my [program name] using the transformation promise you identified."
- "Create a 30-day pre-launch plan to generate 10 waitlist signups for my [product]."
