## THE PROMPT

```
You are a thought leadership strategist and personal branding architect who has helped coaches, consultants, and entrepreneurs become recognized industry authorities. You specialize in identifying the unique intellectual territory that separates thought leaders from content creators — and helping people claim it before someone else does.

I am ready to build real authority in my space. I am past the "just post content" phase. I want to be the name people think of first in my category.

Here is my input:
- My current niche and what I teach: [specific topic area]
- My unique methodology, framework, or approach: [what makes your way different from standard advice]
- My biggest, most controversial opinion in my industry: [the thing you believe that most others don't say]
- The transformation I produce that no one else talks about: [specific outcome or insight that is underserved]
- My content history: [platforms used, audience size, what has performed best]

Do all of the following:

1. AUTHORITY TERRITORY ANALYSIS
Identify the specific intellectual territory I can OWN. What is the unique intersection of my expertise, opinion, and audience need that has not been fully claimed yet? Name 3 "white space" opportunities in my industry.

2. SIGNATURE POV (POINT OF VIEW)
Develop my signature POV — the bold, specific opinion that defines my brand of thinking:
- The central belief that drives everything I teach
- The common industry myth I directly challenge
- My contrarian take that makes people choose a side
- The "if you believe this, you believe me" statement

3. THOUGHT LEADERSHIP CONTENT PILLARS
Design 4 core content pillars that support my authority territory:
- Pillar name and core idea
- Why this topic builds authority
- 3 specific content angles per pillar
- Which format (essay, video, podcast, framework) performs best per pillar

4. THE SIGNATURE FRAMEWORK
Develop or refine my signature framework — the named methodology that becomes synonymous with my brand:
- Framework name (memorable, ownable)
- The 3-5 steps or components
- The unique mechanism that makes it different
- How to teach it in a 60-second explanation

5. AUTHORITY ASSET ROADMAP
Give me a 6-month plan to build undeniable authority:
- Month 1-2: What to create and where to publish
- Month 3-4: Collaboration and amplification strategy
- Month 5-6: Flagship content (book, course, signature talk) to cement authority

Be specific about what makes me different and what territory I can realistically own given my current stage.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Fill in all five [brackets] with your most specific, opinionated answers — bland input = bland positioning
2. Run the Signature Framework by 5 ideal clients before naming it — does it resonate?
3. Use your Thought Leadership Pillars to plan your next 90 days of content
4. The Signature POV becomes your bio, your content hook, and your sales opener

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Develop my [framework name] into a detailed teachable methodology with specific examples for each step."
- "Write my authority bio (200 words) that leads with my POV instead of my credentials."
- "Create a 12-week thought leadership content plan using my 4 pillars."
