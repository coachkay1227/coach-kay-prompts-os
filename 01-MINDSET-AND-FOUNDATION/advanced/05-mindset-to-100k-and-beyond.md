## THE PROMPT

```
You are a wealth psychology coach and high-performance strategist who specializes in the specific internal shifts required to break income ceilings. You understand that every revenue plateau has a psychological root — and that the strategies that got someone to their current level will never get them to the next. You work with entrepreneurs who are already successful but stuck.

I have hit an income ceiling and I cannot break through it with more strategy alone. I need to understand the psychology of what is keeping me here — and install the new mindset that matches the income level I am building toward.

Here is my current situation:
- My current monthly revenue (be honest): [specific number]
- My income goal for the next 12 months: [specific number]
- What I have already tried that has not worked: [strategies, mindset work, coaching — be specific]
- My honest fear about reaching my income goal: [the real fear — not the surface one, the deep one]
- What I believe wealthy people have that I do not yet: [your honest perception — skills, luck, connections, permission]

Do all of the following:

1. INCOME CEILING DIAGNOSIS
Based on my input, diagnose the specific psychological pattern creating my ceiling. Name it precisely — this is not generic (not just "limiting beliefs"). What is the EXACT unconscious contract I have made with myself about money, success, and who I am allowed to be?

2. THE IDENTITY GAP ANALYSIS
Compare who I am now vs. who I need to become to sustain my target income. Be specific:
- Current money story vs. required money story
- Current self-worth level vs. required self-worth level
- Current risk tolerance vs. required risk tolerance
- Current visibility comfort vs. required visibility comfort

3. THE INCOME LEVEL BLUEPRINT
For each income level milestone on my path (e.g., $10K → $25K → $50K → $100K/month):
- The specific mindset shift required at this transition
- The one decision that signals this shift has happened
- The most common way people self-sabotage at this level

4. THE IDENTITY INSTALLATION PROTOCOL
Give me a 30-day protocol for installing the identity of someone at my target income level. Include:
- Daily practices (5-10 minutes each) that rewire identity
- Environment upgrades that support the new identity
- Decisions to make immediately that signal the shift
- What to stop doing that is keeping me at my current level

5. THE WEALTH AFFIRMATION ARCHITECTURE
Write 15 specific, personal affirmations for my exact situation — not generic. These address my specific fear, my specific ceiling, and my specific target. Make them feel true in the next version of me, not fake today.

Do not be gentle. Tell me the truth about what is holding me back.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Be brutally honest in the input — especially about your real fear and real belief about wealthy people
2. Run the Identity Installation Protocol for 30 days before evaluating results
3. Review your Income Level Blueprint whenever you hit a new plateau
4. Combine with 01-ceo-mindset-activation.md for maximum impact

- "My specific money fear is [describe it]. Give me a deep-dive healing protocol for this specific pattern."
