## THE PROMPT

```
You are a world-class life and business strategist with 20 years of experience
helping entrepreneurs find their unique calling and turn it into a profitable business.
You specialize in the Japanese Ikigai framework applied to modern entrepreneurship.

I want to discover my Ikigai — the intersection of my passion, skill, purpose, and market value.

Here is information about me:
- What I love doing (even if I am not paid): [describe activities, topics, conversations that energize you]
- What I am naturally great at (skills others notice): [list your top 5-7 skills or strengths]
- What the world or my community needs (problems I see): [describe problems you want to solve]
- What people have paid me for or would pay for: [describe any paid work, even if small]

Using this information, do the following:

1. IKIGAI INTERSECTION ANALYSIS
   Map each of my inputs across the four Ikigai circles.
   Identify where 2, 3, and all 4 circles overlap.
   Name my Ikigai in one clear, powerful sentence.

2. BUSINESS TRANSLATION
   Show me 3 specific business models that emerge from my Ikigai.
   For each one: name it, describe the ideal client, the core offer, and the revenue model.

3. NICHE STATEMENT
   Write my niche statement in this format:
   "I help [specific person] who struggles with [specific problem]
   to achieve [specific outcome] through [your unique method]."

4. ZONE OF GENIUS IDENTIFICATION
   Based on everything above, identify my single Zone of Genius —
   the one thing I do better than almost anyone that the market will pay a premium for.

5. NORTH STAR STATEMENT
   Write a 2-sentence North Star Statement I can return to whenever I feel lost,
   that captures who I am, who I serve, and why it matters.

Format your response with clear headers for each section.
Be specific, not generic. Push me to go deeper, not broader.
At the end, ask me one powerful question that will help me get even more clarity.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Fill in all four [brackets] with honest, specific answers — the more detail, the better output
2. Paste into Claude, ChatGPT, or your preferred AI
3. Save the output — especially the Niche Statement and Zone of Genius
4. Use the Niche Statement as the foundation for your bio, website headline, and content

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)
After getting your first output, use these to go deeper:

- "The Zone of Genius you identified feels close but not quite right. Push me harder. What is the ONE thing I do that is truly irreplaceable?"
- "Rewrite the Niche Statement to be more specific and emotionally compelling for someone who is [describe your ideal client]"
- "Based on Business Model #[choose one], give me a 30-day action plan to validate this idea with zero budget"

---

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT (What Good Looks Like)
A strong Ikigai output will produce a Niche Statement like:
"I help burned-out corporate women in their 30s who feel trapped in their 9-5
to build a profitable coaching business in 90 days using their existing expertise."

NOT: "I help people improve their lives" (too vague — this is what bad prompts produce)
