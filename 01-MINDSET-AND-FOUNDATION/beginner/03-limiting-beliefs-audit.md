## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES
Surfaces the hidden beliefs that are silently killing your business before it starts.
Most entrepreneurs know what to do — they just cannot make themselves do it.
This prompt finds out exactly why, then rewires it.

## STANDALONE USE
Use this to: Journaling sessions, coaching client prep, self-coaching, course content,
a "mindset module" for your program, or your own breakthrough before a launch.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are a mindset coach and NLP practitioner who specializes in helping entrepreneurs
break through the psychological barriers that keep them stuck in the "almost" stage.
You are known for being empathetic but direct — you do not let people stay comfortable
in their stories. You ask the questions therapists and coaches charge $500/hour to ask.

I want to do a complete limiting beliefs audit.

Here is where I am right now:
- The business I am trying to build: [describe your business or idea]
- The income goal I want to hit in the next 90 days: [your goal]
- The actions I know I should be taking but keep avoiding: [list 3-5 things]
- The stories I tell myself about why I cannot do this: [be honest]
- What I saw modeled about money and success growing up: [be specific]

Now do the following:

1. BELIEF INVENTORY
   Based on my inputs, identify my top 5 limiting beliefs.
   For each belief:
   - State the belief clearly (as if I am saying it)
   - Identify what category it falls under (worthiness, money, fear of judgment, imposter syndrome, perfectionism, etc.)
   - Rate how deeply rooted it appears to be (surface / moderate / deep)

2. BELIEF ORIGIN ANALYSIS
   For my top 2 most damaging beliefs, trace where they likely came from.
   Show me how they made sense then but are actively harming me now.

3. THE REFRAME
   For each of the 5 beliefs, give me a specific, credible reframe —
   not toxic positivity ("just believe in yourself!") but a logical, evidence-based shift
   that I can actually believe.

4. ACTION INTERRUPTS
   For each avoidance behavior I listed, give me one specific action interrupt —
   a tiny action I can take in the next 24 hours that directly confronts that belief.

5. MY NEW BELIEF STATEMENTS
   Write 5 new belief statements that directly replace the old ones.
   Make them specific, personal, and powerful enough to repeat as daily affirmations.
   Format them as "I am someone who..." or "It is safe for me to..."

Format with clear numbered sections. Be direct and specific.
Do not be generic. Treat me like a high-performing athlete who needs honest coaching.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT
1. Answer the setup questions honestly — the more vulnerable, the more powerful the output
2. Screenshot or print your 5 New Belief Statements and read them every morning
3. Assign the 5 Action Interrupts to specific days this week in your calendar
4. Return to this prompt every time you hit a new income ceiling

## THE .1% SECRET
Every income ceiling you hit is a belief ceiling in disguise.
$10K feels impossible until you believe you deserve $10K.
$100K feels impossible until you believe you can lead and scale.
The entrepreneurs who scale fastest are not smarter — they do this work faster.

## ITERATION PROMPTS
- "The belief about [specific belief] feels true because [explain why]. Help me see the evidence against it."
- "Write me a 2-minute morning audio script I can record and listen to every day to reinforce my new belief statements."
- "Create a 7-day mindset reset challenge for someone with my specific beliefs."
