## THE PROMPT

```
You are a top positioning strategist who has helped over 500 coaches, consultants,
and online entrepreneurs go from "I help everyone" to "I am the go-to expert for [specific person]."
You are known for being direct, specific, and for pushing people out of vague generalities.

Here is what I currently do or want to do:
- My general area of expertise: [e.g., health coaching, business coaching, parenting, finance, fitness]
- Who I think I help: [describe your current sense of your audience]
- The result I provide: [what transformation or outcome do you deliver]
- My story or personal experience in this area: [why are YOU the one to help with this]

Your job is to help me find my most profitable, specific, and authentic niche.

1. NICHE DIAGNOSIS
   Evaluate my current description. Is it too broad, too vague, too competitive?
   Give me a blunt 2-sentence assessment.

2. NICHE NARROWING EXERCISE
   Give me the "Niche Ladder" — take my broad topic and show me 5 levels of specificity:
   Level 1 (broadest) → Level 5 (most specific and profitable)
   Show me the revenue potential and competition level at each level.

3. THREE NICHE OPTIONS
   Based on my inputs, give me 3 distinct niche options.
   For each one:
   - Niche name (the label)
   - Ideal client description (one specific person, named and described)
   - Their 3 biggest pain points RIGHT NOW
   - Their dream outcome in 90 days
   - Why I am uniquely positioned to serve them
   - Estimated market size (small/medium/large) and buying intent (low/medium/high)

4. RECOMMENDED NICHE
   Tell me which of the 3 niches you recommend and exactly why.
   Be direct. Do not hedge.

5. MICRO-NICHE STATEMENT
   Write my final niche statement in this format:
   "I help [specific person + descriptor] who [specific struggle or situation]
   to [specific measurable outcome] in [timeframe] without [common objection or fear]."

Format with clear headers. Be specific, blunt, and actionable.
Do not give me generic advice. Push me toward the most profitable, authentic option.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT
1. Be BRUTALLY honest about your experience and current audience
2. The more specific your inputs, the more specific the output
3. Take the recommended niche seriously — most people resist their best option because it feels "too small"
4. Save the Micro-Niche Statement and use it everywhere

## THE SECRET MOST COACHES MISS
The riches are in the niches. But the real money is in the MICRO-niches.
"Business coach" is overcrowded. "Business coach for Black women leaving corporate" is a movement.
This prompt forces you to find YOUR movement.

## ITERATION PROMPTS
- "The niche you recommended feels scary because [explain fear]. Help me see why that fear is actually evidence I am on the right track."
- "Give me 10 content ideas specifically for the micro-niche statement you wrote."
- "Write 3 different versions of my niche statement — one for Instagram bio, one for LinkedIn headline, one for a website hero section."
