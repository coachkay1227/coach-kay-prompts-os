## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES
Builds the bedrock of your personal brand — your story, your positioning, your voice,
and the reason people will choose YOU over every other option in your space.
Personal brand is not your logo. It is the feeling people get when they think of you.

## STANDALONE USE
Use this to: Write your About page, Instagram bio, speaker bio, press kit,
podcast pitch, LinkedIn headline, or anywhere you need to explain who you are
in a way that attracts your ideal client and repels the wrong ones.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are a personal branding strategist who has built brands for coaches, speakers,
authors, and entrepreneurs who went from unknown to industry recognized.
You believe that the most powerful personal brand is built on radical authenticity —
your real story, your real personality, and your real beliefs.

Here is my information:
- My name and what I do: [name + business description]
- My niche (from the niche clarity prompt): [paste your micro-niche statement here]
- My personal story — specifically the before and after: [describe where you were, what happened, where you are now]
- My personality traits (how close friends would describe me): [list 5 descriptors]
- My strong beliefs or opinions about my industry: [what do you believe that most others in your space do not say publicly]
- My unique method or approach: [how do you do what you do differently]
- The transformation my clients experience: [before and after of working with you]

Build my personal brand foundation:

1. BRAND STORY (THE HOOK VERSION)
   Write my brand story in 150 words — the punchy version I use at the top of my about page,
   in podcast intros, and when I meet someone at an event.
   It must have: a hook opening, the struggle, the turning point, the transformation,
   and the mission. Write it in first person, present tense energy.

2. BRAND POSITIONING STATEMENT
   Write my positioning statement in this format:
   "Unlike [the common alternative], [my brand name] is the [category] for [ideal client]
   who wants [outcome] without [sacrifice]. We do this by [unique method]."

3. BRAND VOICE AND TONE
   Based on my personality traits, define my brand voice in 5 words.
   Then write DO and DO NOT guidelines for each word.
   Example: BOLD — DO challenge conventional wisdom. DO NOT be mean or dismissive.

4. MAGNETIC HEADLINE
   Write 5 versions of my personal brand headline — the one sentence that goes
   at the top of my website, Instagram bio, and LinkedIn.
   Vary the approach: benefit-led, story-led, niche-specific, result-led, personality-led.

5. THE POLARIZING STATEMENT
   Write 1 strong opinion or belief statement that clearly expresses my point of view —
   something that will attract my ideal clients and make the wrong clients self-select out.
   This is my brand's stake in the ground.

Format with clear numbered sections. Make everything specific to my story and niche.
This should feel like ME — not generic business speak.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT
1. Paste your niche clarity output from Prompt 02 into the niche field
2. Be honest about your personal story — vulnerability builds trust and sales
3. Use the Brand Story as your "About" section foundation
4. Post the Polarizing Statement as your first bold piece of content

## THE .1% SECRET
Your competitors are competing on credentials. You win on CONNECTION.
The personal brand that wins is not the most polished — it is the most real.
Share the part of your story you are afraid to share. That is your power.

## ITERATION PROMPTS
- "My brand story feels too surface level. Push me deeper. Ask me the questions that will reveal the real turning point."
- "Take my Brand Story and rewrite it as a 3-panel Instagram carousel with each panel as a hook-story-cta structure."
- "Write a LinkedIn post using my Polarizing Statement that will generate comments and shares from my ideal clients."
