## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

Extracts your non-negotiable values and turns them into a clear, powerful vision statement that becomes the decision-making filter for your entire business. When you have this, you stop second-guessing, stop chasing trends, and start building something that actually means something to you.

## STANDALONE USE

Use this to: Create your About page story, write your brand manifesto, define team culture, set strategic priorities, or reconnect to your "why" when motivation drops.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are a strategic business coach and brand architect who has helped hundreds of entrepreneurs clarify their mission and build businesses aligned with their deepest values. You are known for helping people cut through the noise and articulate exactly what they stand for.

I need to create a values-based vision statement that drives every business decision I make. Right now I make decisions inconsistently — sometimes based on money, sometimes on fear, sometimes on what others think I should do.

Here is my input:
- What I believe most deeply about how people should be helped: [your core philosophy on helping others]
- The 3-5 things I will NEVER compromise on in my business: [non-negotiables — integrity, quality, client results, etc.]
- What I want my clients to say about working with me: [the feeling and outcome they describe]
- What I want my legacy to be in 10 years: [the impact and story you want to leave behind]
- What makes me angry about my industry: [what is done wrong that you do differently]

Do all of the following:

1. CORE VALUES EXTRACTION
From my input, identify my top 5 core values. For each one:
- Name the value in 1-3 words
- Write a 2-sentence explanation of what it means in my specific business context
- Give me one non-negotiable business behavior this value requires

2. VISION STATEMENT
Write my personal vision statement — 3-5 sentences — that captures where I am going, who I serve, and why it matters. This should feel true and make me emotional when I read it. Not corporate-speak. My voice.

3. MISSION STATEMENT
Write my mission statement — 1-2 sentences — that describes what I do, for whom, and to what end. This is the operating definition of my business.

4. THE DECISION FILTER
Based on my values, give me a 4-question filter I can run any business decision through:
- Does this [decision] align with [value 1]?
- Does this [decision] serve my ideal client's [specific outcome]?
- Would doing this [decision] make me proud in 5 years?
- Does this [decision] move toward or away from my vision?

5. THE MANIFESTO LINE
Write one powerful, memorable sentence — my brand manifesto — that captures my entire philosophy in a way that makes ideal clients say "that's exactly what I believe."

Format everything clearly. Make the language feel like me based on what I shared, not generic business language.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Fill in all five [brackets] with deep, honest reflection — this is not a quick exercise
2. Take your Vision Statement and put it somewhere visible in your workspace
3. Use the Decision Filter every time you face a major business choice
4. The Manifesto Line becomes your tagline, bio opener, or content hook

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Rewrite the Vision Statement to sound more like [insert your natural speaking style — bold, warm, direct, poetic]."
- "Based on my values and vision, which of these two business decisions aligns better: [option A] vs [option B]?"
- "Create a 100-word brand story based on my values and vision that I can use on my About page."

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT (What Good Looks Like)

A strong Vision Statement sounds like:
"I exist to prove that you don't have to choose between impact and income. I build coaches who build movements — and I won't stop until every talented woman I work with is earning what she's worth and changing lives at scale."

NOT: "I am committed to helping clients achieve their goals through quality coaching services."
