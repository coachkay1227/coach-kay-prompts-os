## THE PROMPT

```
You are a positioning strategist and market research expert who has helped hundreds of online businesses go from "generalist who struggles to sell" to "niche expert clients actively seek out." You specialize in finding the exact sub-niche intersection where someone can charge premium prices with minimal competition.

I currently describe my niche broadly and it is costing me clients and revenue. I need to find my micro-niche — the specific slice of the market where I become the clear, undeniable choice.

Here is what I know about my business:
- My broad niche right now: [e.g., "life coaching" or "business coaching" or "social media marketing"]
- My expertise, background, and unique experiences: [what do you know deeply from real experience]
- The specific results my best clients have gotten: [be specific — "$10K in 30 days" not "made more money"]
- Who I most love working with: [describe them — demographics, mindset, stage of business, personality]
- What my clients ALWAYS ask me about: [the topic that comes up again and again]

Do all of the following:

1. NICHE AUDIT
Analyze my current broad niche. Tell me why it is not working — what objections buyers have, how many competitors I have, and why I am hard to choose over everyone else.

2. 5 MICRO-NICHE OPTIONS
Based on my input, generate 5 specific micro-niche positions I could own. For each one:
- Name the micro-niche (be specific — 10 words or less)
- Define the exact ideal client (one sentence)
- State the specific problem you solve (one sentence)
- Name 2-3 competitors currently in this space and how I differentiate
- Rate the market opportunity 1-10

3. RECOMMENDED MICRO-NICHE
Pick the strongest option from the 5 and explain your reasoning. Tell me the exact opportunity size, why I can win in this space, and what I need to establish authority fast.

4. MICRO-NICHE STATEMENT
Write my new positioning statement in this format:
"I help [very specific person] who [specific painful situation] achieve [specific desirable outcome] in [specific timeframe] without [specific obstacle they fear]."

5. CONTENT DOMINATION STRATEGY
Give me 3 content angles I should post about consistently to establish authority in this micro-niche within 90 days.

Be specific, data-informed, and honest. If my niche has no real market, tell me.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Fill in all five [brackets] honestly — the more specific, the better the micro-niche output
2. Test your top micro-niche choice with 5 pieces of content before committing fully
3. Update your bio, website, and all social profiles with the new Micro-Niche Statement
4. Return to this prompt every 6 months as you evolve

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "For micro-niche option [choose one], give me a 30-day content plan to establish authority."
- "Search my micro-niche and tell me the 5 biggest content gaps I could fill to become the go-to expert."
- "Write 5 Instagram bio variations for my chosen micro-niche that make ideal clients immediately say 'that's me.'"

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT (What Good Looks Like)

A strong Micro-Niche Statement looks like:
"I help burned-out 6-figure corporate women in their late 30s who feel invisible in their careers to build a profitable executive coaching practice in 90 days using their existing credentials — without quitting their job first."

NOT: "I help professionals achieve their goals through personalized coaching."
