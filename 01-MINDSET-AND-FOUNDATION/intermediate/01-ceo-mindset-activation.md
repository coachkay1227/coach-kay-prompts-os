## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

Permanently rewires how you think about your business, your time, and your decisions. This prompt eliminates the employee mindset that keeps entrepreneurs undercharging, overworking, and second-guessing every move — and installs the CEO operating system that drives $100K+ results.

## STANDALONE USE

Use this to: Break through a plateau, reset after burnout, prepare for a big launch, overcome fear of raising prices, or shift into leadership mode when you're about to hire your first team member.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are an elite executive coach who has worked with Fortune 500 CEOs and 7-figure online business owners. You specialize in the psychology of leadership — specifically the mental shift from "operator" to "owner" thinking that separates six-figure entrepreneurs from everyone else.

I am an entrepreneur who has been stuck in employee mode. I work IN my business instead of ON it. I undercharge, I do everything myself, and I make reactive decisions instead of strategic ones.

Here is my current situation:
- My business type and what I sell: [describe your offer or business model]
- My biggest mindset block right now: [fear, perfectionism, imposter syndrome, people pleasing — be specific]
- How I currently make decisions: [reactive vs. strategic, gut vs. data, solo vs. with a team]
- My revenue goal for the next 12 months: [specific dollar number]

Do all of the following:

1. CEO IDENTITY AUDIT
Give me an honest assessment of where I am operating from employee mindset vs. CEO mindset. Use specific examples based on what I shared. Score me 1-10 in: Strategic Thinking, Delegation Readiness, Pricing Confidence, Boundary Setting, and Vision Clarity. Explain each score.

2. THE 5 MINDSET SHIFTS
Identify the 5 specific mental shifts I need to make to operate as a CEO at my income goal. For each shift:
- Name the old limiting belief I am holding
- Name the new CEO belief that replaces it
- Give me one concrete action I can take in the next 7 days to embody it

3. CEO MORNING PROTOCOL
Design a 30-minute morning routine specifically for my business stage that gets me into CEO thinking mode before I open email or social media. Make it practical, sequenced, and non-negotiable.

4. THE DECISION FILTER
Give me a simple CEO decision-making framework — 4 questions I ask before making any business decision — based on my goals and current stage. This replaces gut-reaction decision making.

5. THE CEO DECLARATION
Write me a powerful personal declaration — 10 sentences — that I read daily to reinforce my CEO identity. Make it specific to my revenue goal and business type. Not generic affirmations — real, specific, identity-level statements.

Format each section with clear headers. Be direct, challenging, and specific. Push me to take ownership. Do not soften the feedback.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Fill in all four [brackets] with complete, honest answers — vague input produces generic output
2. Run this BEFORE a big launch, price increase, or anytime you feel stuck or burned out
3. Save the CEO Declaration — print it, put it in your phone notes, read it every morning
4. Return to this prompt every 90 days as your business and income level grow

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

After getting your first output, go deeper with these:
- "The mindset shift around [choose one] feels hard to implement. Give me 3 real-life scenarios where I practice this shift this week."
- "Create a 21-day CEO mindset training plan with one daily micro-practice per day."
- "I'm struggling with imposter syndrome around [specific situation]. Give me the exact CEO thought process for this situation."

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT (What Good Looks Like)

A strong CEO Mindset output will produce a Declaration like:
"I am the CEO of a $[goal] business. I make decisions from vision, not fear. I delegate everything outside my zone of genius. I charge what my transformation is worth. I build systems, not just revenue..."

NOT: "I believe in myself and my abilities" (too vague — this is what weak prompts produce)
