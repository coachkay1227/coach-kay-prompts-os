## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

Takes your income goal and reverse-engineers it into a specific, executable 90-day plan with weekly milestones, daily actions, and built-in accountability systems. This is not motivational planning — this is math-based strategic execution.

## STANDALONE USE

Use this to: Start a new quarter, relaunch after a slow period, plan a specific launch, create a 90-day sprint for any revenue goal, or build your first business roadmap.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are a strategic business planning expert and revenue architecture specialist. You work with entrepreneurs to reverse-engineer income goals into specific, daily-actionable plans. You are known for turning vague "I want to make more money" goals into precise 90-day execution systems.

I need a real 90-day plan — not inspiration, not motivation, actual math and action steps.

Here is my situation:
- My 90-day revenue goal: [specific dollar amount — e.g., $15,000 or $50,000]
- My current offer(s) and price points: [list what you sell and what it costs]
- My current audience size: [email list, Instagram followers, Facebook group — give real numbers]
- My biggest constraint right now: [time, money, audience, confidence, tech — be honest]
- How many hours per week I can work on my business: [realistic number]

Do all of the following:

1. REVENUE MATH BREAKDOWN
Break down exactly how I hit my goal:
- How many sales of each offer I need
- At what conversion rate, how many leads that requires
- Broken into monthly and weekly targets
- Show the math clearly in a table format

2. 90-DAY PHASE PLAN
Break the 90 days into 3 phases of 30 days each:
- Phase 1 (Days 1-30): Foundation and audience building
- Phase 2 (Days 31-60): Active selling and momentum
- Phase 3 (Days 61-90): Optimization and scale
For each phase, give me 3 specific objectives and 5 weekly actions.

3. WEEKLY SPRINT TEMPLATE
Design a repeatable weekly schedule based on my available hours that covers: content creation, lead generation, sales conversations, delivery/fulfillment, and business development. Assign hours to each.

4. THE 90-DAY MILESTONES
Give me 9 specific milestones (one per 10-day period) with measurable indicators so I know if I am on track or need to adjust.

5. FAILURE AUDIT
Tell me the 3 most likely reasons this plan will fail based on my constraints, and give me a specific contingency plan for each.

Be realistic. If my goal is not achievable in 90 days with my constraints, tell me — and give me the adjusted target that IS achievable.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Fill in all five [brackets] with real numbers — guessing kills the plan
2. Put your weekly sprint template into your calendar as recurring time blocks BEFORE starting
3. Review your milestones every 10 days and adjust if needed
4. If you hit Phase 1 goals early, run this prompt again with a higher Phase 3 target

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "I hit/missed the [specific milestone]. What should I adjust for the next 10 days?"
- "My biggest bottleneck right now is [specific constraint]. Redesign the plan around this constraint."
- "Create a daily task list for week [number] of my 90-day plan based on Phase [1/2/3] objectives."

---

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT (What Good Looks Like)

A strong 90-day plan includes specific math like:
"To hit $15,000 you need 3 sales of your $5,000 program. At 10% close rate, you need 30 qualified sales conversations. That is 2.5 conversations per week for 12 weeks — achievable with [specific lead gen strategy]."

NOT: "Work hard, stay consistent, and believe in yourself." (This is not a plan.)
