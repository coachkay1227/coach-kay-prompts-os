## THE PROMPT

```
You are a consumer psychology expert and market research specialist who helps entrepreneurs build deep, accurate profiles of their ideal buyers. You have studied buyer behavior across coaching, digital products, and service businesses for 15 years. You know that most avatars are surface-level guesses — you build ones that actually predict buying behavior.

I need a real ideal client avatar — not guesses, but a researched, psychographic profile I can use to write copy, build offers, and create content that converts.

Here is my input:
- What I sell and the price point: [describe your offer and price]
- Who I believe my ideal client is right now: [your best guess — be as specific as possible]
- The top 3 results your best clients have gotten: [real outcomes, real numbers if possible]
- What your ideal client says when they first reach out to you: [their actual words, their problem as they describe it]
- What your ideal client says after they finish working with you: [testimonial language, transformation language]

Do all of the following:

1. FULL AVATAR PROFILE
Build a complete profile including:
- Name, age, location, relationship status (representative, not restrictive)
- Career and income situation
- Daily life and schedule
- Social media behavior and consumption habits
- Where they spend their money and why

2. PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE (This is what most avatars miss)
- Their #1 deepest fear related to my offer category
- Their secret desire they would never say out loud
- Their internal story about why they have not succeeded yet
- Their relationship with money and investing in themselves
- What they tell their friends about their problem vs. what they actually believe

3. BUYING TRIGGERS
List the 5 specific triggers that would make this person buy from me TODAY:
- What would make them say "this is the right time"
- What would make them say "this is the right person"
- What objections come up and what resolves each one
- What they need to see/hear/feel before saying yes

4. EXACT LANGUAGE MAP
Give me 10 phrases — in their voice — that I can use directly in my marketing:
- 5 pain phrases (how they describe the problem)
- 5 desire phrases (how they describe the outcome they want)

5. WHERE TO FIND THEM
List the top 5 specific places this person spends time online — platforms, communities, accounts they follow — and what kind of content they engage with most.

Make this feel like a real human, not a marketing template.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Fill in all five [brackets] — use real client language if you have it, best guesses if you don't
2. Validate this avatar by running 3 real conversations with people who match this description
3. Update it every 6 months — your ideal client evolves as you do
4. Give this profile to any AI before writing content or copy

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Based on this avatar, write a 5-email welcome sequence for a new subscriber."
- "Create a 30-day content calendar that speaks directly to this ideal client's fears and desires."
- "Write 3 different sales page headlines for my [offer] using this avatar's exact language."

---

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT (What Good Looks Like)

A strong avatar includes specific language like:
Pain phrase: "I've been posting for 6 months and I have nothing to show for it."
Desire phrase: "I just want someone to tell me exactly what to do so I can finally get clients without feeling gross about selling."

NOT: "They want to grow their business and make more money." (This is not an avatar — this is a guess.)
