# 01 — MINDSET AND FOUNDATION
## "Know Who You Are Before You Build"

> This is the category most entrepreneurs skip — and why most fail.
> Before strategy, before content, before offers: you need unshakeable clarity.
> This is Coach Kay's superpower and your unfair advantage.

## WHY THIS CATEGORY EXISTS

Every $100K business was built by someone who knew exactly who they were,
who they served, and why it mattered. This category gives you that foundation.
Without it, everything else you build will feel off, attract the wrong clients,
and fall apart when things get hard.
