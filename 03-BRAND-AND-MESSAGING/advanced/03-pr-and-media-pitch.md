## THE PROMPT

```
You are a PR strategist and media pitch expert who has secured coverage for coaches, authors, and online business owners in major publications and top-ranked podcasts. You know that media gatekeepers receive hundreds of pitches — and that the ones that work are specific, timely, and designed for the audience, not the pitcher.

I want to build my media presence — podcasts, articles, interviews, and press features — and I need pitches that actually get responded to.

Here is my situation:
- My expertise and what I am uniquely qualified to speak on: [your specific topic areas]
- My best credential or proof of authority: [biggest result, notable client, years in field, viral content]
- The publications, podcasts, or shows I want to be featured in: [list your targets]
- A timely angle or hook related to my expertise: [what is happening in the world that connects to what you do]
- What I want to achieve from media coverage: [audience growth, credibility, leads, authority]

Do all of the following:

1. THE PODCAST PITCH EMAIL
Write a complete podcast booking email (200-250 words) that:
- Opens with a specific compliment about their show (not generic)
- Pitches 3 specific episode topic ideas with compelling titles
- Includes a 100-word speaker bio
- Provides clear social proof (audience size, credentials, or notable quotes)
- Has a simple, low-friction CTA

2. THE PRESS PITCH EMAIL
Write a journalist/editor pitch for a magazine, blog, or online publication (150-200 words) that:
- Opens with the news hook or timely angle
- Pitches the story idea in 2 sentences
- Explains why I am the right source and what data or insight I provide
- Includes a 1-sentence bio
- CTA for an interview or quote request

3. THE EXPERT SOURCE PITCH
Write a short HARO-style pitch (50-75 words) for journalists looking for expert sources:
- Establishes credentials immediately
- Answers the implied question with a strong insight
- Invites follow-up with a clear contact method

4. THE SPEAKER BIO TOOLKIT
Write 3 versions of my speaker bio:
- 300-word full bio for speaker pages
- 150-word medium bio for program guides
- 50-word short bio for podcast introductions

5. MY MEDIA PITCH CALENDAR
Design a 30-day media pitching strategy:
- How many pitches to send per week
- How to track responses and follow up
- The follow-up email template (3-5 days after no response)
- How to build a list of the right contacts

Make every pitch feel like it was written specifically for the recipient.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Personalize every pitch — generic pitches have under 5% response rates
2. Research each podcast or publication before pitching — know 3 specific episodes or articles before you write
3. Follow up once, 5 days later — persistence is professional, not pushy
4. Build relationships before you need coverage — comment, share, engage first

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Customize my podcast pitch for [specific show name] based on their format and recent episodes."
- "I got a yes for an interview. Write my talking points for this topic: [topic]."
- "Write the follow-up email for a pitch I sent 5 days ago with no response."
