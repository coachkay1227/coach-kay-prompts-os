## THE PROMPT

```
You are a brand strategist and brand identity consultant who creates brand books for personal brands and coaching businesses. You know that brand consistency is the single biggest driver of trust and that most personal brands are inconsistent because no one has written down the rules.

I need to create a complete brand book — a living document that defines my brand standards and gives any team member or AI tool the context to represent my brand correctly.

Here is my brand foundation:
- My brand name and tagline: [name and tagline]
- My mission and values: [what you stand for]
- My ideal client and voice: [who you serve and how you sound]
- My current visual brand: [colors, fonts, style if you have them — or your preferences]
- My content platforms and content types: [where you show up and what you create]

Do all of the following:

1. BRAND IDENTITY SECTION
Write the Brand Identity chapter:
- Brand story (200 words — the narrative version of what this brand is)
- Mission statement (1-2 sentences)
- Vision statement (1-2 sentences)
- Core values (5 values with 2-sentence descriptions each)
- Brand personality (5 adjectives with behavioral examples)
- Target audience profile (1 full paragraph)

2. VISUAL BRAND GUIDELINES
Create the visual standards section:
- Color palette guidance (primary, secondary, accent — with usage rules)
- Typography recommendations (heading, body, accent fonts)
- Photography and imagery style guide (what kind of images to use and avoid)
- Design principles (clean/bold/minimal/organic — describe the aesthetic)
- What NOT to use (visual elements that are off-brand)

3. VOICE AND TONE GUIDE
Build the full voice and tone chapter:
- Brand voice in 4 dimensions (refer to the Brand Voice Guide prompt for detail)
- Do/Do Not list (10 each)
- Platform tone variations (how voice shifts slightly on Instagram vs. LinkedIn vs. email)
- Sample copy in 5 different contexts

4. CONTENT STANDARDS
Define the content rules:
- Content pillars and what belongs in each
- Post format standards per platform
- Caption structure and length guidelines
- Hashtag strategy and limits
- Visual content standards (video, graphics, photos)

5. BRAND USAGE RULES
Write the rules for anyone using the brand:
- What team members can post on their own channels about the brand
- How to credit or tag the brand
- What requires approval before publishing
- How to handle brand mistakes or off-voice content

Format this as a real brand document — sections, headers, examples.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Build this BEFORE hiring — you cannot onboard a VA without brand standards
2. Keep it in Notion, Google Docs, or a shared folder — it is a living document, not a one-time project
3. Update it when your brand evolves, not after problems occur
4. Give this doc to any AI (including Claude) at the start of every content session

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Create a 1-page brand quick reference card from my brand book — something my VA can pin above their desk."
- "Build a content checklist from my brand book that I run every post through before publishing."
- "Create a brand onboarding document for a new team member joining my business."
