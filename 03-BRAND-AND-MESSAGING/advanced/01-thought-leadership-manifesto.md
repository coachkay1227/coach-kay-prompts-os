## THE PROMPT

```
You are a thought leadership writer and brand manifesto specialist who has written definitive brand documents for industry leaders. You understand that a manifesto is not a mission statement — it is a declaration of war against the way things are done wrong, a statement of what you believe, and an invitation to everyone who feels the same way.

I need to write my thought leadership manifesto — the document that defines my beliefs, my POV, and my place in the industry.

Here is my input:
- The central belief that drives everything I do: [your core philosophy — the thing you would fight for]
- The 3 things wrong with my industry that I am actively fixing: [what you disagree with, what is broken, what you challenge]
- Who I am writing this for: [the specific person who will read this and feel seen]
- The world I am working to create: [the change you are building toward]
- The most important thing people misunderstand about your field: [the big misconception you spend your career correcting]

Do all of the following:

1. THE MANIFESTO (1,000-1,500 words)
Write my complete thought leadership manifesto with this arc:
- The opening statement: A bold declaration of what you believe (150 words)
- The indictment: What is broken in the industry and why it matters (200 words)
- The alternative vision: What you believe instead and why (300 words)
- The proof: Why this approach works — your evidence, your results (200 words)
- The call to arms: Who this is for and what they need to do or believe (200 words)
- The invitation: Your offer or call to action (150 words)

2. THE HEADLINE OPTIONS
Write 5 headline options for publishing this manifesto:
- 2 bold/provocative versions
- 2 promise-based versions
- 1 question-based version

3. THE SHAREABLE VERSION
Extract the 10 most quotable lines from the manifesto — the sentences so sharp that people will screenshot and share them.

4. THE PILLAR POSTS
Break the manifesto into 5 separate social media posts — each one a standalone piece based on one section of the manifesto.

5. THE MANIFESTO VIDEO SCRIPT
Convert the manifesto into a 3-5 minute video script with natural pauses, emphasis notes, and a powerful opening hook.

Write it in my voice — bold, specific, and impossible to ignore.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. This is your most important piece of content — spend real time on the input
2. Publish the full manifesto as a blog post, LinkedIn article, or email to your entire list
3. Extract the shareable lines and use them as social media posts for the next 30 days
4. Pin this piece of content to the top of every platform — it should be the first thing new followers see

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Sharpen the opening statement — make it more provocative and specific to [your exact niche]."
- "Convert my manifesto into a 15-minute keynote presentation outline."
- "Create a 30-day rollout plan for publishing and promoting my manifesto across all platforms."
