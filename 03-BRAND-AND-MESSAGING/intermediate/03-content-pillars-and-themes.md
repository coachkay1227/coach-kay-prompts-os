## THE PROMPT

```
You are a content strategy architect and personal brand specialist who has designed content pillars for coaches, consultants, and creators with audiences from 1,000 to 1,000,000 followers. You know that most content strategies fail because they are too broad, too random, or too educational without being strategic.

I need to define my core content pillars — the specific topics I will own and return to repeatedly to build authority and attract buyers.

Here is my brand foundation:
- My niche and what I help people with: [your topic area and transformation]
- My ideal client and what they struggle with: [who they are and their biggest challenges]
- My 3 strongest areas of expertise: [what you know most deeply]
- The business goal my content must support: [more leads? more trust? more sales? specific offer?]
- Platforms I create for: [Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, email, podcast — which ones?]

Do all of the following:

1. THE 5 CONTENT PILLAR DESIGN
Design my 5 strategic content pillars:

For each pillar:
- Pillar name (how I refer to this topic)
- Core idea: The central belief or knowledge area
- Why this builds authority: How this positions me as an expert
- Why this attracts buyers: How this creates demand for my offer
- 10 specific content angles (topics within this pillar I can create from)
- Best format for this pillar (short video, long post, carousel, email, etc.)
- Posting frequency recommendation

2. THE PILLAR BALANCE CHECK
Show me how the 5 pillars work together:
- Which pillars build awareness?
- Which pillars build trust and authority?
- Which pillars build desire for my offer?
- Which pillars drive conversion?
Is there the right balance or am I missing a key function?

3. THE NEVER-RUN-OUT CONTENT MATRIX
Build a content matrix using my 5 pillars:
- 5 pillars x 5 content angles each = 25 base ideas
- 25 base ideas x 4 formats each = 100 content pieces
Show me the first 25 specific content titles I can use immediately.

4. THE SIGNATURE SERIES IDEA
Design 1 signature content series for me — a recurring format or theme that becomes "my thing" (e.g., "My [Day] series," "Behind the business," "Client wins," "The [your name] method"):
- Name of the series
- The recurring format or framework
- Why this specific series is perfect for my brand
- 10 episode or post ideas to start with

5. THE PLATFORM CUSTOMIZATION
Tell me how to adapt my 5 pillars for each of my chosen platforms — what works differently on Instagram vs. LinkedIn vs. TikTok vs. email.

Make this a system, not just a list of ideas.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Commit to your 5 pillars for 90 days before evaluating — authority is built through repetition
2. Never post outside your pillars — every piece of content should fit somewhere
3. Use the Content Matrix to batch-create 3-4 weeks of content at once
4. Track which pillar drives the most engagement AND the most sales — they are not always the same

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Create a 30-day content calendar using my 5 pillars with specific post topics for each day."
- "For Pillar [number], give me 20 more content angles I have not used yet."
- "Write 5 full posts (one per pillar) in my brand voice as examples I can use or adapt."
