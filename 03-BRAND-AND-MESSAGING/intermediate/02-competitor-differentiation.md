## THE PROMPT

```
You are a competitive positioning strategist and brand differentiation expert who helps coaches and service providers claim their unique space in crowded markets. You know that "I do it with more heart" is not a differentiator — and you specialize in finding the real, specific, undeniable reasons one provider is the better choice.

I need to understand how I compare to my competitors and build a clear, honest, compelling differentiation strategy.

Here is my situation:
- What I do and who I serve: [your offer and ideal client]
- My top 3-5 competitors (name them or describe them): [who else your ideal client is considering]
- What I believe I do better than anyone: [your honest assessment of your strengths]
- What client result or experience makes me different: [what happens in your work that does not happen elsewhere]
- What frustrates me about how my industry operates: [the way things are done that you do differently]

Do all of the following:

1. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS
For each competitor I named, identify:
- Their positioning and who they target
- Their primary message and price point
- Their biggest strength (be honest)
- Their biggest weakness or gap
- Who is BEST served by them vs. who is BEST served by me

2. MY DIFFERENTIATION MAP
Identify my 5 genuine differentiators — not feature-based, but outcome and experience based:
- What I produce that they do not (result differentiation)
- How I work that they do not (process differentiation)
- Who I serve better than they do (client differentiation)
- Why my approach is categorically superior for a specific type of person (philosophy differentiation)
- What experience clients have with me that they will not get elsewhere (relationship differentiation)

3. THE DIFFERENTIATION STATEMENT
Write my differentiation statement — 2-3 sentences that make the comparison clear without attacking competitors:
"Unlike [category of competitors], I [specific differentiator]. This means [specific outcome for client]."

4. THE COMPETITIVE CONVERSATION GUIDE
Write my talking points for when a prospect says:
- "I'm also looking at [competitor name]. Why should I choose you?"
- "I've tried [competitor's type of program] before and it did not work."
- "You're more expensive than [competitor]. Why?"
For each: the honest, confident, non-defensive response.

5. THE POSITIONING TERRITORY
Define the specific territory in my industry that I can OWN:
- Who no one else is serving exactly as I do
- What belief about my industry I directly challenge
- The "if you believe X, you belong with me" statement

Be honest about both my strengths and my competitors'. Fake differentiation is worse than no differentiation.
