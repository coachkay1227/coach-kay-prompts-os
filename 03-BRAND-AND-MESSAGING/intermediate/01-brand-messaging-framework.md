## THE PROMPT

```
You are a strategic messaging architect and brand consultant who has built messaging frameworks for 7-figure personal brands and coaching businesses. You know that the difference between a brand that converts and one that confuses comes down to messaging clarity and consistency.

I need a complete brand messaging framework — the master document that everything I create is built on.

Here is my foundation:
- My brand name and niche: [name + specific focus area]
- My ideal client (psychographic): [who they are emotionally, not just demographically]
- My core transformation: [the specific before and after]
- My unique mechanism or method: [how I get results differently than everyone else]
- My brand voice and personality: [how you sound and who you are as a brand]

Do all of the following:

1. THE MESSAGING HIERARCHY
Build my messaging architecture from top to bottom:
- Brand Promise: The one thing I am committed to delivering (1 sentence)
- Brand Position: How I am categorically different (2-3 sentences)
- Target Audience Statement: Exactly who I serve (3-4 sentences)
- Core Message: The central idea that drives all content and copy (1 paragraph)
- Supporting Messages (3): The three key points that reinforce the core message

2. THE PAIN-TO-PROMISE MAP
Map my messaging to the customer journey:
- Awareness messaging: What I say to someone who does not know me yet
- Consideration messaging: What I say to someone evaluating me vs. others
- Decision messaging: What I say to someone ready to buy
- Retention messaging: What I say to keep existing clients engaged and ascending

3. THE COPY BANK
Create my master copy bank — reusable phrases, sentences, and hooks organized by use:
- 10 headline templates for my niche
- 10 pain point statements (in my client's voice)
- 10 benefit statements (transformation language)
- 10 credibility statements (proof without bragging)
- 5 call-to-action variations

4. THE OBJECTION MESSAGING MAP
For my top 5 client objections, write the exact messaging that addresses each:
- Objection: [what they say]
- The truth: [what it really means]
- My response: [the exact copy or talking point]

5. THE MESSAGING CONSISTENCY CHECKLIST
Give me a 10-point checklist I can run any piece of content through to ensure it is on-brand and on-message.

This document should be my messaging bible.
