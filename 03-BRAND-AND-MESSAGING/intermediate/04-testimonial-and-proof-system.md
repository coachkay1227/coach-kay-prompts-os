## THE PROMPT

```
You are a social proof strategist and conversion copywriter who specializes in turning client results into compelling proof assets that sell. You know that most testimonials are weak ("Great coach! 5 stars!") and most case studies are too long for anyone to read. You build proof systems that actually convert.

I need a complete system for collecting, creating, and deploying social proof across my entire business.

Here is my situation:
- What I sell and the transformation I deliver: [your offer and the result]
- Client results I already have: [list your best results — with specifics and numbers if possible]
- Where I need social proof most: [sales page, social media, email, discovery calls, website]
- My current testimonial collection process: [how you currently get testimonials — or the fact that you do not have a system]

Do all of the following:

1. THE TESTIMONIAL COLLECTION SYSTEM
Design my end-to-end testimonial process:
- The exact 5 questions I ask clients to get powerful, specific testimonials (not generic ones)
- When in the client journey to ask (timing is everything)
- The follow-up sequence if they do not respond
- How to ask for permission to use their words and image
- The format to collect in (video vs. written vs. audio — and when to use each)

2. THE CASE STUDY FORMULA
Write the template for my signature case study:
- The "before" snapshot: Where the client started (paint the pain)
- The "during" narrative: What we worked on and the key moments
- The "after" proof: Specific, measurable results
- The "future" forward: What is possible now that was not before
- The client quote: The one sentence that captures the whole story

3. THE PROOF ASSET LIBRARY
Design the types of proof I need and how to create each:
- Screenshot testimonials (for social media)
- Video testimonials (for sales pages and ads)
- Written case studies (for email and website)
- Data and results snapshots (for credibility in pitches)
- Transformation photos or before/after comparisons (if applicable)

4. THE DEPLOYMENT MAP
Tell me where to use each type of proof and exactly how:
- On my sales page: Where to place proof and in what format
- On social media: The proof post formats that perform best
- In my email sequences: When to send proof-based emails and what to say
- On discovery calls: How to use testimonials verbally without sounding braggy
- In my bio and profiles: The one-line proof statements that create instant credibility

5. THE PROOF REQUEST EMAIL TEMPLATE
Write the exact email I send to a client who just got a great result asking for a testimonial — natural, warm, specific, and easy for them to say yes to.

Turn proof into a system, not an afterthought.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Set up your testimonial collection process NOW — do not wait until you have more results
2. Video testimonials convert 3-5x better than written — make it easy for clients to record a 60-second video
3. Specific proof (numbers, timeframes, named results) outperforms general praise every time
4. Build a "proof library" folder in Google Drive — sort testimonials by type, topic, and offer

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "I have this client result: [describe it]. Write a complete case study using my case study formula."
- "Edit this testimonial to be more specific and powerful without changing the meaning: [paste testimonial]."
- "Create a 'Wall of Love' section for my sales page using these testimonials: [paste your best ones]."
