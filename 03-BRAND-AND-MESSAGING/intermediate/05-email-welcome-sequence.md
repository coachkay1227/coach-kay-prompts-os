## THE PROMPT

```
You are an email marketing strategist and conversion copywriter who has written welcome sequences generating millions in revenue for online businesses. You know that the first 7 days a subscriber is on your list are the most important — they are evaluating you, deciding if you are worth their attention, and forming a belief about what you can do for them.

I need a 5-email welcome sequence that starts the moment someone joins my list and ends with them ready to buy.

Here is my situation:
- What they signed up for (my lead magnet): [what the subscriber opted in for]
- My email list goal: [to sell what product or offer ultimately?]
- My brand voice: [how you sound — warm? bold? direct? educational?]
- My best client result or story: [the most powerful proof of what you do]
- What I want them to do by Email 5: [the specific action — book a call, buy a product, apply, etc.]

Do all of the following:

1. THE 5-EMAIL SEQUENCE
Write all 5 emails in full — subject lines, preheaders, body copy, and CTAs:

Email 1 (Immediate — Day 0): The Welcome
- Deliver the lead magnet
- Set expectations for the sequence
- Share your origin story in 2-3 paragraphs
- One small, low-friction CTA

Email 2 (Day 2): The Education
- Your best free piece of advice or insight
- Positions you as an authority
- Creates "aha moment" and desire for more
- CTA: reply with their question (builds relationship)

Email 3 (Day 4): The Proof
- A specific client transformation story
- Written like a mini case study (before, during, after)
- Creates belief: "this could work for me"
- CTA: soft mention of your offer

Email 4 (Day 6): The Belief Shift
- Address the #1 objection or limiting belief holding them back
- Share the insight that changes how they see the problem
- Position your offer as the obvious solution
- CTA: direct link to your offer with urgency

Email 5 (Day 8): The Offer
- The direct pitch email
- Recap what you have shared this week
- Make the offer clearly and confidently
- Include social proof
- Create urgency (limited time, limited spots, or simply the cost of inaction)
- Clear, specific CTA

2. THE SUBJECT LINE SWIPE FILE
For each email, write 3 alternative subject lines so I can A/B test.

3. THE SEQUENCE OPTIMIZATION NOTES
Tell me the #1 thing that kills welcome sequence performance and how to avoid it in my sequence.

Write all emails in my brand voice — not generic corporate marketing speak.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Set this sequence up in your email platform BEFORE driving traffic to your opt-in — build the funnel first
2. Track open rates AND click rates — open rate shows the subject line, click rate shows the body
3. If Email 4 or 5 converts below 1%, the sequence needs a better proof story or a stronger offer bridge
4. Never stop at 5 emails — after this sequence ends, move subscribers into a nurture sequence

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Rewrite Email [number] in a more [warm/bold/urgent/conversational] tone."
- "My welcome sequence has a 2% open rate on Email 3. What do I change in the subject line and first sentence?"
- "Write Email 6 — a re-engagement email for subscribers who did not open Emails 4 or 5."
