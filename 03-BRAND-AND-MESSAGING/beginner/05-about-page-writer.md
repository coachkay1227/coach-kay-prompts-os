## THE PROMPT

```
You are a conversion copywriter and brand storytelling expert who specializes in About pages that do one thing: make the reader feel so seen, so confident in your expertise, and so connected to your story that they immediately want to work with you. You know that an About page is not about you — it is about what you can do for them.

I need to rewrite my About page. Currently it either reads like a resume, sounds too humble, or does not lead anywhere.

Here is my raw material:
- My name and what I do: [your name, your title, your work]
- My origin story (why I do this work): [the key moments — what happened, what changed]
- My credentials and experience (what makes me qualified): [degrees, certifications, years of experience, notable accomplishments]
- My ideal client and their problem: [who you serve and what they are struggling with]
- The results I have produced for clients: [specific outcomes — with numbers when possible]
- My personality quirks and personal details: [what makes you human — what do you love, where you live, what matters to you]

Do all of the following:

1. THE COMPLETE ABOUT PAGE
Write a complete About page using this structure:
- Opening hook: Start with THEM, not you (what they are experiencing right now)
- The pivot: "That is why I built..." (bridge to your work)
- Your story: The abbreviated origin story (150-200 words — why this matters to you)
- Your credibility: Proof in a natural, non-braggy way
- Your results: What clients achieve (in their words or specific outcomes)
- The human moment: 3-5 personal details that make you real
- The invitation: A clear, specific call to action

2. THREE HEADLINE OPTIONS
Write 3 different opening headline options for the page, each leading with a different angle:
- Version A: Leads with empathy for the reader
- Version B: Leads with your bold claim
- Version C: Leads with a question that makes them nod

3. THE SHORT BIO VERSION
Write a 100-word version for speaker pages, guest bios, and social media.

4. THE ONE-PARAGRAPH VERSION
Write a 50-word version for press releases, podcast bios, and email footers.

5. CREDIBILITY PLACEMENT GUIDE
Tell me where to put my credentials and proof on this page so they build trust without dominating the story.

Write in first person, conversational tone. This is a conversation, not a performance.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. The opening line of your About page determines whether they stay or leave — test 3 different openers
2. Your About page should have ONE clear call to action — not three, not zero
3. Add a photo that matches the energy of your brand — warmth, confidence, authenticity
4. Update your About page every 6 months — it should evolve with your results and story

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "The opening of my About page feels weak. Here is the current version: [paste it]. Rewrite it to be more compelling."
- "Add a section to my About page for [client testimonials / credentials / media features]."
- "Rewrite my About page for a specific audience: [describe the specific reader you are targeting]."
