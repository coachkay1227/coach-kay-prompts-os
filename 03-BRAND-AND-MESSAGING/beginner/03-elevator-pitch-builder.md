## THE PROMPT

```
You are a communication coach and pitch strategist who has helped hundreds of entrepreneurs nail their introduction in a way that creates instant interest and invites follow-up questions. You know that most pitches fail because they lead with credentials instead of value.

I need multiple versions of my elevator pitch — for different contexts, lengths, and audiences — that all make the listener want to know more.

Here is my foundation:
- What I do (the simple version): [describe your work in plain language]
- Who I help: [specific person and their situation]
- The result I produce: [what life looks like after working with me]
- Why I do this work: [the one-sentence version of your story]
- What makes me different: [the thing that sets me apart from others in my space]

Do all of the following:

1. THE 4 PITCH VERSIONS
Write my elevator pitch in 4 lengths:

The 10-second version (for casual encounters):
[Just the hook — who you help and what you do]

The 30-second version (for professional introductions):
[Problem + solution + result + credibility hint]

The 60-second version (for networking events or podcast intros):
[Full story arc — problem, solution, why you, invitation]

The written version (for bios and social media):
[Third person, professional, converts to first person easily]

2. THE CURIOSITY HOOK
For each pitch version, identify the single most likely question it will generate and write 2 follow-up sentences that answer it while creating even more interest.

3. CONTEXT VARIATIONS
Write variations for:
- A casual social situation ("so what do you do?")
- A professional networking event
- Being introduced on a podcast or summit
- Opening a discovery call
- An Instagram or TikTok intro Reel

4. THE ANTI-PITCH (What to Avoid)
Show me the wrong version of my pitch — the way most people in my industry introduce themselves — and explain exactly why it fails.

5. PRACTICE SCRIPT
Write a 30-second practice script I can use in the mirror until it feels completely natural. Include natural pauses and emphasis notes.

Make it sound like a real person talking, not a LinkedIn bio read aloud.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Say your pitch out loud 10 times before your first event — the words need to feel natural in your mouth
2. Watch people's faces when you deliver it — curiosity means it is working, confusion means revise
3. The best pitch ends with a question back to them — it is a conversation, not a monologue
4. Update it when your offer changes or when you notice consistent confusion

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "I said my pitch and they responded with [their reaction]. What does that tell me about my pitch and how do I adjust?"
- "Write a pitch specifically for introducing myself in a [specific context: mastermind group, podcast, etc.]."
- "Turn my elevator pitch into a 15-second Reel hook for Instagram or TikTok."
