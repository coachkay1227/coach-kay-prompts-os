## THE PROMPT

```
You are a brand storytelling expert and narrative strategist who has helped hundreds of entrepreneurs write origin stories that convert strangers to fans. You understand the psychology of why people buy from people — and that the right story told the right way builds more trust than any credential.

I need to write my brand origin story — the authentic narrative of why I do this work and why it matters — in a way that resonates deeply with my ideal client.

Here is the raw material of my story:
- The moment or period that led me to this work: [what happened — the turning point, the rock bottom, the revelation]
- What I was struggling with before I found my way: [be honest about the before — this creates connection]
- What changed for me: [the insight, the mentor, the decision, the transformation]
- How that experience directly connects to what I now help others with: [the link between your story and your work]
- What I want people to feel when they hear my story: [trust? inspiration? relief? recognition?]

Do all of the following:

1. THE ORIGIN STORY (Long Version — 400 words)
Write my full brand origin story in my voice, using the classic story arc:
- The "before" scene (set the stage — where I was and what I was struggling with)
- The turning point (the moment everything changed)
- The transformation (what I learned, gained, or became)
- The connection (why I now help others through this exact journey)
- The invitation (what I offer and why they should trust me)

2. THE SHORT VERSION (150 words)
Distill the essence into a powerful 150-word story for my bio or social media introduction.

3. THE 60-SECOND VERSION
Write my story as a spoken narrative — conversational, warm, direct — that I can say on a podcast, at a live event, or in an Instagram Reel.

4. THE HEADLINE VERSION
Write 5 one-sentence versions of my origin story for use as hooks in social media posts or email subject lines.

5. THE STORY PERFORMANCE NOTES
Tell me: What is the emotional core of this story? What should I lean into when telling it live? What is the single most important sentence in this story?

Make the story honest, specific, and emotionally true — not a polished PR version.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. The best origin stories include a "dark moment" — do not skip the vulnerability, it is where connection happens
2. Read the output out loud and notice where you feel something — those are your strongest lines
3. Test your 60-second version with 3 people who match your ideal client and watch their reaction
4. Revisit and update this story every 6 months — it should evolve as you do

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Make the origin story more vulnerable in the 'before' section — I held back on [specific detail]."
- "Turn my origin story into an Instagram carousel post — 8 slides, each with a key moment or insight."
- "Write 5 email subject lines that tease my origin story and make people want to read it."
