## THE PROMPT

```
You are a brand naming and tagline expert who has written memorable brand phrases for coaches, creators, and companies. You know the difference between a tagline that sticks and one that gets forgotten — and it is not just cleverness, it is truth told memorably.

I need a tagline for my brand — a short, memorable phrase that captures my brand promise and sticks in the minds of my ideal clients.

Here is my brand foundation:
- My brand name or personal name: [your name or business name]
- What I do in plain language: [no jargon — explain it like you are talking to a friend]
- The core transformation I deliver: [from X to Y — be specific]
- The emotion I want people to feel when they hear my tagline: [inspired? empowered? seen? ready?]
- My brand personality: [bold? warm? witty? serious? rebellious? aspirational?]

Do all of the following:

1. THE 20 TAGLINE OPTIONS
Generate 20 tagline options across these 5 styles:

Action-oriented (4 options): Taglines that start with a verb and command attention
Transformation-focused (4 options): Taglines that speak to the before/after journey
Identity-based (4 options): Taglines that speak to who the client becomes
Results-focused (4 options): Taglines that name the specific outcome
Disruption-based (4 options): Taglines that challenge the status quo or industry norms

2. THE TOP 5 WITH ANALYSIS
Select the 5 strongest options and for each:
- Why it works for my specific brand
- What emotion it evokes in the ideal client
- Where it works best (website, bio, events, merchandise)
- Potential weakness or misinterpretation

3. THE RECOMMENDED WINNER
Pick the single strongest tagline and explain:
- Why this one over the others
- How to say it with the right energy
- Where to place it first (your #1 priority spot)

4. THE TAGLINE IN CONTEXT
Show me the recommended tagline used in:
- Website hero section (paired with a subtitle)
- Instagram bio
- Email signature
- Event introduction
- A merchandise item

5. THE SECONDARY TAGLINE
Create a secondary tagline (the "sub-tagline" or campaign tagline) that can rotate — for promotions, launches, or seasonal content.

Make it memorable first, clever second.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Test your top 3 taglines with 10 ideal clients — ask "what does this make you feel?" not "do you like it?"
2. A tagline that perfectly captures your brand but confuses your audience is worthless — clarity beats cleverness
3. Commit to one tagline for at least 12 months before changing — brand equity takes repetition
4. The best taglines feel inevitable in hindsight — simple, true, and impossible to forget

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "My top candidates are [A] and [B]. Ask me 5 questions to help me decide between them."
- "Take my chosen tagline and create 10 variations for social media content using it as a recurring hook."
- "Write a website hero section using my tagline: [tagline]. Include headline, subheadline, and CTA."
