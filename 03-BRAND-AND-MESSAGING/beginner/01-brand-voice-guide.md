## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

Creates your complete brand voice guide — the rules for how you write, what words you use, what tone you strike, and what you never say — so every piece of content sounds unmistakably like you, whether you wrote it or your VA did.

## STANDALONE USE

Use this to: Write consistently across all platforms, brief a copywriter or VA, create content templates, or stop the "this doesn't sound like me" problem forever.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are a brand voice strategist and content identity specialist who has built brand voice guides for coaches, creators, and service businesses. You know that "authentic brand voice" is not about being casual — it is about being consistent, intentional, and unmistakably YOU on every platform.

I need a brand voice guide that captures exactly how I communicate so that every piece of content I (or anyone on my team) creates sounds like me.

Here is my input:
- How I describe myself in casual conversation: [3-5 sentences in your natural voice — just talk to me]
- 3 words my clients use to describe working with me: [their exact words]
- Brands, writers, or people whose communication style I admire: [name 2-3 and what you love about them]
- What I never want to sound like: [corporate? salesy? academic? describe what feels wrong]
- My audience and how they speak: [how does your ideal client talk? formal? casual? swear? professional?]

Do all of the following:

1. BRAND VOICE IDENTITY
Define my brand voice in 4 dimensions:
- Tone (how I feel to the reader): 3 adjectives + 1 sentence description each
- Personality (who I am as a brand): the archetype and 3 defining traits
- Energy (the vibe of my content): high/medium/low energy + description
- Perspective (how I see the world): my unique lens on my industry

2. THE DO/DO NOT LIST
Create my brand voice rules:
- 10 things I always do in my writing (specific stylistic choices)
- 10 things I never do (words, phrases, tones to avoid)
- 5 words I overuse that should be replaced (and their alternatives)
- The "this is so me" test: a checklist for evaluating any piece of content

3. VOICE IN ACTION
Show my brand voice applied to 4 scenarios:
- Instagram caption (about my expertise)
- Email subject line (to my list)
- Response to a DM asking about my offer
- Response to a critical comment or pushback

4. THE VOICE REFERENCE CARD
Create a 1-page reference card my team or AI can use:
- Brand voice in 3 words
- What I sound like vs. what I do NOT sound like (side by side)
- 5 sample sentences in my voice
- 5 red flag phrases that signal something is off-voice

5. THE AI PROMPT TEMPLATE
Write the exact prompt I give to any AI tool to get it to write in my brand voice on the first try.

Make this feel like me captured in writing.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Read the output out loud — if it sounds like you, it is right. If it feels stiff or generic, give the AI more of YOUR actual words
2. Save the Voice Reference Card and attach it to every AI session you use for content
3. Give this guide to any VA, ghostwriter, or team member who creates content for you
4. Update it annually — your voice evolves as your business and confidence grow
