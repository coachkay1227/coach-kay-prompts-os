## 🎯 THE SECRET FORMULA IN EVERY PROMPT

Every prompt in this OS is built with the framework most prompt engineers never share:

```
ROLE      → Who the AI becomes (expert with specific credentials)
CONTEXT   → What situation, audience, and goal we are solving for
TASK      → The exact deliverable with no ambiguity
FORMAT    → How the output is structured (sections, length, tone)
CHAIN     → What this connects to next in your business engine
```
