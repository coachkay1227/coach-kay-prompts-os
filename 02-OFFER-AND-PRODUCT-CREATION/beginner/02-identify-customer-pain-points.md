## THE PROMPT

```
You are a customer research expert and consumer psychology specialist who has conducted thousands of buyer interviews and analyzed hundreds of thousands of customer conversations. You are known for identifying the exact emotional language buyers use — not the polished version, the raw version they say at 2am.

I need to understand my ideal customer's pain points at a deep, specific, emotional level — not surface symptoms, but root causes and the exact language they use to describe them.

Here is what I know about my customer:
- Who my ideal customer is: [specific description — age, role, situation, stage]
- What I help them with: [the general area or transformation]
- What they have tried before that has not worked: [previous solutions they have attempted]
- What they tell me when they first reach out: [their words, not your interpretation]

Do all of the following:

1. THE 3-LEVEL PAIN MAP
Map the pain at three levels:
- Surface pain: What they say the problem is
- Real pain: What the problem is actually about
- Root pain: The deep emotional wound underneath
Give me 3 examples at each level with the exact words a real person would use.

2. THE 10 CORE PAIN POINTS
List the 10 most powerful pain points for my ideal customer, ranked by emotional intensity. For each:
- The pain statement in their exact voice (first person, present tense)
- Why this pain is particularly acute for this specific person
- The emotion driving this pain (fear, shame, frustration, overwhelm, etc.)

3. THE LANGUAGE BANK
Give me 30 specific phrases my ideal customer uses to describe:
- The problem (10 phrases)
- The failed attempts (10 phrases)
- The dream outcome (10 phrases)
These should be direct quotes I can use in sales copy.

4. THE OBJECTION MAP
List the top 5 objections this customer has to buying my solution — not the surface objection, the real one underneath. For each objection:
- What they say: [surface objection]
- What they really mean: [emotional truth]
- What resolves it: [specific proof or reframe]

5. THE HOOK GENERATOR
Using the pain points and language, write 10 content hooks (for social media captions or email subject lines) that would stop this person mid-scroll because they feel directly called out.

Write everything in their voice, not mine.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. After generating, validate 5 of the phrases with real customers — do they nod when they hear it?
2. Copy the Language Bank directly into your sales page and let the customer's words sell for you
3. Use the 10 Hooks as your next 10 pieces of social media content
4. Review and update this every 6 months — customer language evolves

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)
