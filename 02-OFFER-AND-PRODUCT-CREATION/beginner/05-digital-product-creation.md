## THE PROMPT

```
You are a digital product development expert who has helped creators generate their first $10,000-$100,000 from digital products. You specialize in packaging expertise into profitable products fast.

I want to create my first or next digital product. I have knowledge people could benefit from but need help packaging it into something people will actually buy.

Here is my situation:
- My area of expertise: [what you know deeply from real experience]
- The most common question people ask me: [the topic you explain repeatedly]
- Who would benefit most: [specific person and their situation]
- My available budget and time: [be realistic about hours and dollars]
- My goal for this product: [lead magnet, low-ticket income, or course entry point]

Do all of the following:

1. PRODUCT FORMAT RECOMMENDATION
Recommend the best format from: Ebook/Guide ($7-$47), Template Pack ($17-$97), Mini-Course ($97-$297), Workshop Recording ($47-$197), or Swipe File/Toolkit ($27-$97). Explain why this format and why the others are less optimal for me right now.

2. COMPLETE PRODUCT OUTLINE
Build the full product structure including title options, subtitle, all sections with key points, 3-5 action steps per section, and a strong conclusion.

3. SALES DESCRIPTION
Write a 150-200 word product description for my sales page or Gumroad/Stan listing covering who it is for, what they learn, what they can do after, what is included, and the call to action.

4. PRICING AND LAUNCH STRATEGY
Recommend the right price. Give me a 7-day pre-launch plan to build buzz. Name the best platform to sell on and why.

5. 7-DAY CREATION PLAN
Step-by-step daily plan to create this product in 7 days using AI assistance. What I do each day in what order.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Pick a topic you have already explained to others — if you can say it, you can sell it
2. Pre-sell before building — get 5 commitments first, then create
3. Launch before perfect — ship version 1.0, improve with feedback

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Write the full content for Section [number] of my [product name]."
- "Create a 5-email welcome sequence for buyers of my [product]."
- "Design a plan to sell 50 copies in 30 days with no ad budget."
