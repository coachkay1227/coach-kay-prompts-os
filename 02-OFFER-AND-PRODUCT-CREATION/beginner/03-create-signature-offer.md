## THE PROMPT

```
You are a premium offer design specialist and packaging expert who has helped hundreds of coaches, consultants, and service providers create offers that sell. You are known for your ability to take scattered expertise and craft it into one clear, compelling, high-value offer that clients understand immediately and say yes to quickly.

I need to package my expertise into a proper offer. Right now I either sell my time by the hour or I have a vague description of "coaching" that confuses potential clients.

Here is what I bring:
- My expertise and specific skills: [list what you know and what you can do]
- The specific result I produce for clients: [be as specific as possible — outcome, timeframe]
- My ideal client and their starting point: [who they are and where they are when they come to me]
- What I currently charge or what I think I should charge: [your price or price range]
- How much time I can dedicate to this offer per client: [hours per week, months of engagement]

Do all of the following:

1. OFFER ARCHITECTURE
Design the complete structure of my signature offer:
- Offer name (memorable, outcome-focused, not generic)
- The one-sentence transformation promise
- What is included (exact deliverables, access, support)
- Duration and format (weeks, 1:1 calls, group, async, etc.)
- What the client walks away with (tangible outcomes, not activities)

2. THE IRRESISTIBILITY AUDIT
Rate my offer concept 1-10 on these 5 irresistibility factors:
- Specificity (is the result crystal clear?)
- Desirability (do people desperately want this?)
- Believability (is the promise credible?)
- Exclusivity (does this feel special, not generic?)
- Urgency (is there a reason to buy now?)
Tell me what to change to make each score a 9+.

3. THE OFFER ONE-LINER
Write 3 versions of my offer explained in one sentence. Each version leads with a different angle:
- Version 1: Leads with the problem
- Version 2: Leads with the outcome
- Version 3: Leads with the unique method

4. THE VALUE STACK
Build the value stack for my offer — show the total value of everything included with individual value assignments so the price feels like a deal:
- Core component value: $[X]
- Bonus 1 value: $[X]
- Bonus 2 value: $[X]
- Total value: $[X]
- Your price: $[X]

5. THE OFFER PAGE OUTLINE
Give me a complete outline for my offer description (sales page, DM script, or live pitch) with these sections in order:
- Hook (the problem they have right now)
- Agitate (what happens if they keep doing nothing)
- Introduce (your unique solution)
- Explain (what is included)
- Prove (who has gotten results)
- Invite (specific call to action)

Make the offer feel premium and specific, not cheap and vague.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Fill in all five [brackets] with real specifics — vague input creates vague offers
2. Run the output by 3 ideal clients: "Would you buy this? What would make you say yes faster?"
3. Start with ONE signature offer — do not build multiple before the first one sells
4. Update the offer after your first 5 clients give you feedback on what they valued most

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "My offer got feedback that [specific objection]. Redesign the packaging to address this."
- "Write the full sales page for this offer using the Offer Page Outline."
- "Create 3 different price tier options for this offer (basic/standard/premium)."
