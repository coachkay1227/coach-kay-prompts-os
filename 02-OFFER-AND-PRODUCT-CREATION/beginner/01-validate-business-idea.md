# VALIDATE BUSINESS IDEA — Test Your Idea Before Investing Time and Money

## Category: 02 - Offer and Product Creation | Level: BEGINNER

## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

Runs your business idea through a rigorous validation framework to determine if there is real market demand before you spend a single dollar or hour building it. Most entrepreneurs skip this and build what they want to sell — not what people will actually buy.

## STANDALONE USE

Use this to: Test any new business idea, evaluate a pivot, validate a new offer, or decide between multiple business concepts before committing.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are a business validation expert and startup strategist who has evaluated hundreds of business ideas across coaching, digital products, services, and e-commerce. You have a track record of saving entrepreneurs from building things no one wants — and you are known for being direct, honest, and data-grounded.

I have a business idea and I need to know if it is worth pursuing before I invest significant time or money. Do not tell me what I want to hear — tell me what I need to hear.

Here is my idea:
- The business idea in one sentence: [describe what you want to sell and to whom]
- Why I think people will pay for this: [your honest hypothesis]
- Who I think will buy it: [as specific as you can be about the target customer]
- What similar things already exist: [competitors, alternatives, adjacent products]
- How I plan to reach potential customers: [your distribution idea]

Do all of the following:

1. MARKET DEMAND ASSESSMENT
Evaluate whether real, paying demand exists for this idea. Rate demand 1-10 and explain:
- Is this a vitamin (nice to have) or painkiller (must have)?
- Are people actively searching for this solution?
- What evidence of demand exists right now?
- What is the realistic addressable market?

2. COMPETITION ANALYSIS
Assess the competitive landscape:
- Who are the top 3-5 competitors or alternatives?
- What are they charging?
- What gap exists that my idea could fill?
- Is competition a sign of market health or a red flag here?

3. VALIDATION SCORE (10-Point Framework)
Score my idea on 10 validation criteria, 1-10 each:
- Problem severity (how painful is the problem?)
- Market size (how many potential buyers?)
- Willingness to pay (will they actually spend money?)
- Timing (is now the right time?)
- Founder-market fit (am I the right person?)
- Distribution access (can I reach the buyers?)
- Competitive advantage (why me over others?)
- Revenue model viability (is the math possible?)
- Scalability (can this grow?)
- Execution difficulty (can I actually build this?)
Total score and verdict: GO / WAIT / PIVOT

4. THE 5-DAY VALIDATION EXPERIMENT
Give me a specific 5-day experiment to validate this idea with zero budget:
- Day 1: [specific action]
- Day 2: [specific action]
- Day 3: [specific action]
- Day 4: [specific action]
- Day 5: [evaluate results using these specific criteria]

5. THE HONEST VERDICT
Tell me directly: Should I pursue this idea, pivot it, or kill it? If pivot — what pivot? If kill — what should I pursue instead based on what I shared?

Be honest even if the verdict is not what I want to hear.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Fill in all five [brackets] with your actual idea — no hiding weaknesses, they will come out in the market anyway
2. Run the 5-Day Validation Experiment BEFORE building anything
3. If you score below 50/100, take the pivot advice seriously before investing more time
4. A strong score does not guarantee success — it means the idea is worth the next step

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "My 5-day experiment got [these results]. Does this confirm or change the validation verdict?"
- "The idea passed validation. Now help me identify my most likely first 10 customers specifically."
- "The idea needs to pivot. Here are my strengths: [list]. What validated business idea fits these strengths?"

---

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT (What Good Looks Like)

A strong validation verdict sounds like:
"Your idea scores 67/100. The problem is real and painful, but your proposed distribution channel (cold outreach) will make customer acquisition unsustainably expensive. The pivot: partner with existing communities instead of building from scratch. Here's why this changes everything..."

NOT: "Sounds like a great idea! There's definitely a market for this." (This is not validation.)
