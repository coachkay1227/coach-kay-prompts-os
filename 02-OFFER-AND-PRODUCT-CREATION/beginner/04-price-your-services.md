## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

Calculates your right pricing based on market data, value delivered, income goals, and competitive positioning — then gives you the exact scripts to confidently present and defend that price. Underpricing is the #1 mistake beginners make. This stops it.

## STANDALONE USE

Use this to: Price your first offer, raise your rates, justify premium pricing, create tiered packages, or respond to "that's too expensive" confidently.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are a pricing strategist and revenue optimization expert who has helped hundreds of coaches and service providers 2-5x their income by fixing their pricing. You understand that pricing is not just math — it is positioning, psychology, and confidence. You specialize in helping entrepreneurs charge what they are worth without apologizing for it.

I need to figure out what to charge. I either undercharge (and attract bad clients), overcharge without confidence (and get ghosted), or charge randomly with no strategy.

Here is my situation:
- What I offer and what the outcome is for clients: [describe your service/program and the result]
- What I currently charge or am considering charging: [your current or proposed price]
- The market rate for similar services: [what competitors charge — research this first]
- My income goal per month: [specific number]
- How many clients I can realistically serve at one time: [capacity]

Do all of the following:

1. PRICING MATH
Run the income math for me:
- At my current price, how many clients do I need per month to hit my goal?
- Is that number realistic given my capacity?
- What price point makes the math work with a comfortable number of clients?
- Show me 3 price scenarios (low/mid/high) with the math for each

2. VALUE-BASED PRICING ANALYSIS
Calculate what my service is WORTH, not just what time it takes:
- What is the minimum economic value I create for clients? (time saved, revenue generated, cost avoided)
- What is the emotional/life value I create? (stress eliminated, confidence gained, life change)
- Based on this, what price range is actually justified?
- Where should I price relative to this value to feel like a deal?

3. MARKET POSITIONING PRICE
Analyze the competitive landscape:
- Premium position: What do top-tier providers charge and what justifies it?
- Mid-market position: The standard market rate
- Entry position: The beginner price that gets you started
Where should I position and why, given my current proof and stage?

4. THE PRICE CONFIDENCE SCRIPT
Write me 3 scripts for presenting my price confidently:
- The direct price reveal (no apology, no justification)
- The value-first presentation (show value before price)
- The objection handler for "that's too expensive"
Each script should be 5-8 sentences in natural, conversational language.

5. THE PRICE INCREASE ROADMAP
Give me a 12-month pricing progression:
- Start price (now)
- 3-month raise (after [specific milestone])
- 6-month raise (after [specific milestone])
- 12-month target price
With the criteria I need to hit to justify each increase confidently.

Give me numbers, not philosophy.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Research real competitor pricing BEFORE filling in the brackets — do not guess
2. Test the Price Confidence Script out loud before your next sales call — say it until it feels natural
3. Commit to the 12-Month Roadmap and do not lower prices out of fear — raise them on schedule
4. If you hear "too expensive" more than 3 times in a row, run this prompt again — something is misaligned

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "I want to raise my price from $[X] to $[Y]. Write a client announcement and the exact justification."
- "I get 'that's too expensive' a lot. Here is exactly what I say and what they say back: [script]. Fix my response."
- "Create a 3-tier pricing structure for my [offer] at $[low], $[mid], $[high] with what is included at each tier."
