## THE PROMPT

```
You are a service design architect and business systems expert who has helped coaches, consultants, and agencies productize their expertise into scalable, repeatable service offerings. You know that freedom comes from systems — not from working harder.

I need to turn my custom 1:1 work into a productized service that I can systematize, price clearly, and eventually delegate without losing quality.

Here is my current service:
- What I currently do for clients 1:1: [describe the work in detail]
- The typical timeline and deliverables: [how long, what they receive]
- What varies client to client vs. what is always the same: [the custom vs. repeatable elements]
- My income goal and how many clients I want: [revenue target and capacity]
- What I want to eventually be able to delegate: [tasks, roles you want off your plate]

Do all of the following:

1. PRODUCTIZATION ANALYSIS
Identify which parts of my service can be standardized and which require true customization:
- The repeatable 80%: What always happens the same way
- The custom 20%: What genuinely requires personalized attention
- What the productized version looks like: The defined scope, timeline, and deliverables

2. THE PRODUCTIZED SERVICE DESIGN
Build the complete productized offer:
- Service name (clear, specific, outcome-focused)
- The exact scope of work (what is included, what is not)
- A fixed timeline with phases and milestones
- A clear intake process that captures all needed information upfront
- Pricing rationale: why this is now worth more than hourly

3. THE DELIVERY SYSTEM
Create the operating system for delivering this service:
- The client onboarding checklist (what you collect and set up)
- The production/delivery workflow (step by step)
- Quality control checkpoints
- Client communication protocol (when and how you communicate)
- Completion and offboarding process

4. THE DELEGATION MAP
Design how this service can eventually be delivered by a team:
- Which parts can a VA, contractor, or junior team member handle?
- What requires a senior person?
- What is the hire sequence: who do you hire first, second, third?
- What SOPs need to be documented?

5. PRICING AND PACKAGING
Show me how productization changes the pricing model:
- From hourly to project-based to retainer pricing
- Price increase rationale (why you can charge more for a defined product)
- Package options (basic/standard/premium tiers)
- Recurring revenue opportunity embedded in this service

Make this a business system, not just a service description.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Document your current 1:1 process in detail BEFORE running this prompt — you need to see what is already repeatable
2. Run 3 clients through the new productized system before delegating — validate it works first
3. Create video SOPs for every repeatable task as you do them — this is your delegation library
4. Price the productized version 20-30% higher than your hourly equivalent — clarity commands a premium

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Write the full SOP for [specific step] of my productized service delivery."
- "Create the client onboarding questionnaire for my [service name] to collect everything I need upfront."
- "Design the hiring profile and interview questions for my first team member on this service."
