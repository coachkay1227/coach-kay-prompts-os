## THE PROMPT

```
You are an intellectual property strategist and licensing model designer who has helped coaches and consultants build certification and licensing programs that generate $200K-$1M+ in passive and semi-passive revenue. You know the difference between a methodology that stays personal and one that becomes a certifiable system.

I am ready to license or certify my methodology — to create a program that other people can teach and pay me ongoing royalties or licensing fees for.

Here is my situation:
- My core methodology or framework: [describe your signature approach or system in detail]
- What makes it unique and proven: [your results, years of refinement, what makes it different]
- Who would want to teach this methodology: [other coaches, corporate trainers, HR departments, wellness practitioners, etc.]
- My ideal licensing or certification revenue goal: [annual income from this revenue stream]
- How much involvement I want after setup: [fully passive or semi-active role]

Do all of the following:

1. CERTIFICATION PROGRAM DESIGN
Design the complete certification program:
- Program name and credentials offered
- Who can become certified (prerequisites and application criteria)
- The curriculum (what certified practitioners learn to teach)
- Assessment and testing methodology
- Ongoing requirements to maintain certification status
- What certified practitioners can and cannot do with the license

2. LICENSING MODEL OPTIONS
Present 3 different licensing structures with pros and cons:
- Option A: Annual flat-fee license ($X/year per practitioner)
- Option B: Revenue share model (% of each client's payment)
- Option C: Cohort-based certification ($X per person per certification cohort)
Recommend the best model for my goals and current stage.

3. IP PROTECTION STRATEGY
Outline the intellectual property protection approach:
- What to trademark, copyright, and document
- The licensing agreement key clauses (what to include to protect your IP)
- How to prevent unauthorized use
- Brand standards practitioners must follow

4. THE GO-TO-MARKET PLAN
Design how to launch and fill the first certification cohort:
- Target audience for practitioners (who wants to get certified?)
- Where to find and recruit the first 10-20 certified practitioners
- Pricing for the founding cohort vs. ongoing price
- Content and marketing to attract practitioners, not clients

5. THE PRACTITIONER SUPPORT SYSTEM
Design the ongoing infrastructure for certified practitioners:
- Continuing education and training
- Community and peer support
- Marketing support and referral system
- Quality control and brand protection

This should feel like building a franchise, not just a course.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Only certify a methodology you have used with at least 20-30 clients with documented results
2. Your first cohort should be people you know and trust — your early practitioners become your best marketers
3. Build the assessment process carefully — weak certification standards kill the value of the credential
4. Plan for ongoing practitioner support — certified practitioners are your partners, not just customers

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Write the application criteria and form for practitioners applying to my [certification name]."
- "Design the practitioner training curriculum for my [framework name] certification — full outline."
- "Draft the key clauses of my licensing agreement in plain language."
