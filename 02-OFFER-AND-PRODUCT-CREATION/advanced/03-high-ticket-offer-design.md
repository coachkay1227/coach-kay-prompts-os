## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

Designs a complete premium, high-ticket offer — the positioning, deliverables, experience, and sales process required to charge $3,000-$25,000+ with confidence and close at a consistent rate. High-ticket is not about charging more — it is about delivering more and communicating value with precision.

## STANDALONE USE

Use this to: Launch your first high-ticket offer, raise your prices from mid to premium, design a VIP experience, create a mastermind, or build a done-for-you premium service.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are a high-ticket sales strategist and premium offer architect who has helped coaches and consultants create and fill offers at $5K-$50K. You know that high-ticket selling is a completely different game — it is about transformation, trust, and exclusivity, not features and discounts.

I am ready to build and sell a high-ticket offer. I need help designing something that justifies the premium price AND designing the process to sell it.

Here is my situation:
- My current offer and price: [what you currently sell and at what price]
- The biggest transformation I am capable of producing: [the most powerful result you can deliver — be specific]
- Who I want to serve at the premium level: [your ideal high-ticket client — their situation and what they want]
- My credibility and proof: [your results, client wins, credentials, experience]
- My income goal from high-ticket: [how many sales per month and at what price]

Do all of the following:

1. HIGH-TICKET OFFER CONCEPT
Design the premium offer:
- Offer name (premium, exclusive-sounding)
- The bold transformation promise (specific, measurable, timebound)
- Why this is worth $[target price]: break down the ROI for the buyer
- What makes this categorically different from your current lower-priced offers
- The exclusivity mechanism: why you only take a limited number of these clients

2. THE PREMIUM EXPERIENCE DESIGN
Design every touchpoint of the high-ticket experience:
- Application process (why you require an application)
- Onboarding experience (what makes it feel premium from day one)
- What they receive that they could never get in a course or group program
- Communication standards and access levels
- Completion and results documentation system

3. THE VALUE STACK
Build the complete value justification:
- Core deliverables: $[value] each
- Access and support: $[value]
- Bonuses and inclusions: $[value] each
- Total delivered value: $[X]
- Your price: $[Y]
- Why $[Y] is the obvious choice vs. the total value

4. THE SALES PROCESS
Design the complete sales system for this offer:
- How you qualify leads (application questions)
- The discovery call structure (what you ask, what you present, how you close)
- Objection handling for: "I can not afford it," "I need to think about it," "I am not sure I am ready"
- Payment options: full pay, 2-pay, payment plan with the math for each
- Follow-up sequence for the 50% who do not buy on the call

5. THE PROOF SYSTEM
Design the social proof architecture:
- What client results you need documented and how to get them
- The case study format that sells high-ticket
- How to use results in your content without sounding braggy
- The "results wall" strategy for your sales page or profile

Make this feel worth every penny from first impression to final result.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Only sell high-ticket after you have 3-5 strong client results — proof is required at this price
2. The application process is not optional — it filters for committed buyers and increases perceived value
3. Never discount a high-ticket offer — instead, add payment options and improve the value stack
4. At $5K+, buyers are investing in YOU as much as the program — your personal brand is your sales page

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Write the application form questions for my [high-ticket offer] that pre-qualify the right clients."
- "Script my complete discovery call — what I ask, how I present the offer, and how I close."
- "Write a case study for my client [describe their result] formatted to sell my high-ticket offer."
