## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

Designs a complete membership or community business model — the pricing, the content calendar, the retention strategy, and the community culture that keeps members paying month after month. Memberships are the most powerful path to predictable, recurring revenue for coaches and creators.

## STANDALONE USE

Use this to: Launch your first membership, rebuild a membership that is losing retention, add recurring revenue to your existing business, or design a community that becomes your primary marketing engine.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are a membership business strategist and community design expert who has helped coaches and creators build memberships that retain members for 12+ months. You know that most memberships fail within 6 months because they are built around content, not community and transformation.

I want to build a membership that generates predictable recurring revenue and a community people never want to leave.

Here is my situation:
- My expertise and what I teach: [your topic and approach]
- Who I want to serve in this membership: [specific ideal member]
- The ongoing problem or transformation this membership supports: [the never-ending need that justifies monthly payment]
- My income goal from the membership: [monthly MRR target]
- What I have already built: [audience, email list, current offers]

Do all of the following:

1. MEMBERSHIP CONCEPT DESIGN
Define the membership identity:
- Membership name and tagline
- The core "reason to join" — the transformation or community they cannot get elsewhere
- The reason to STAY — what keeps them coming back month after month
- The "unfair advantage" for members vs. non-members

2. PRICING AND TIER STRUCTURE
Design the pricing model:
- Monthly and annual price options with the annual discount strategy
- 2-3 membership tiers with what is included at each level
- Price rationale: what would make this a no-brainer investment?
- Founding member pricing strategy: how to launch at a discount that creates urgency

3. THE CONTENT AND EXPERIENCE CALENDAR
Design the monthly member experience:
- Weekly: What members receive or experience every week
- Monthly: The signature deliverable, live call, or event
- Quarterly: The big milestone or transformation event
- Annually: What makes Year 2 feel as valuable as Year 1

4. COMMUNITY RETENTION SYSTEM
Design the systems that keep members engaged:
- Onboarding: The first 30 days of a new member's experience
- Engagement triggers: What pulls quiet members back in
- Celebration system: How you recognize member wins publicly
- Churn prevention: The warning signs someone is about to leave and how to intervene

5. LAUNCH STRATEGY
Design the founding member launch:
- Founding member pricing and deadline
- How to fill the first 50 members in 30 days
- The waitlist and pre-launch build strategy
- What to say in your launch content to make people feel the community pull

Build for retention first — acquisition is easy, retention is where memberships live or die.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Talk to 10 ideal members before designing the content — what would they pay for monthly that they do not have now?
2. Launch with 20-30 founding members before building all the content — validate retention first
3. Track monthly churn rate every 30 days — above 5% means something in the experience is broken
4. The best retention strategy is relationships, not content volume

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Design the first 30 days of onboarding for a new member of my [membership name]."
- "Create a monthly content calendar for my membership with themes, deliverables, and live call topics."
- "Write my founding member launch email sequence (5 emails) that fills my membership in 7 days."
