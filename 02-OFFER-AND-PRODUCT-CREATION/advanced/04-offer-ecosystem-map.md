## THE PROMPT

```
You are a revenue architecture strategist who specializes in mapping complete business ecosystems for coaches and online business owners. You have helped over 50 businesses design offer suites that generate $500K-$2M annually through smart sequencing and customer journey optimization.

I need a complete ecosystem map of my business — every offer I have or should have, how they connect, and how a single customer can move from their first encounter with me to my highest offer.

Here is my complete business:
- All current offers with prices: [list every product and service you currently have]
- Your highest-impact transformation (what you do best): [the most powerful thing you do]
- Annual revenue goal: [specific number]
- Target lifetime customer value: [how much should one loyal customer spend over 2 years?]
- Missing offers you suspect you need: [what gaps have clients asked about?]

Do all of the following:

1. ECOSYSTEM AUDIT
Audit my current offer mix:
- What is working (high conversion, strong margin)?
- What is missing (gaps in the journey where customers fall out)?
- What should be retired (offers that dilute focus or confuse buyers)?
- Revenue concentration risk: am I too dependent on one offer?

2. THE COMPLETE ECOSYSTEM MAP
Build the master map of my business — every offer at every tier:
- Awareness tier: Free content and lead magnets
- Entry tier ($0-$197): First purchase products
- Core tier ($497-$2,000): Main transformation offers
- Premium tier ($3K-$15K): High-ticket experiences
- Continuity tier ($47-$497/month): Recurring revenue
- Partnership tier: Affiliate, licensing, referral revenue

For each tier: current offers, gaps to fill, and revenue potential.

3. THE CUSTOMER JOURNEY PATHS
Map the 3 most likely paths a new lead takes through my ecosystem:
- Path A: The quick buyer (buys within 7 days of discovering me)
- Path B: The slow builder (takes 30-90 days to convert)
- Path C: The high-ticket buyer (skips lower tiers, goes directly to premium)
For each path: the sequence of offers, the trigger to move them forward, and the revenue potential.

4. LIFETIME VALUE OPTIMIZATION
Show me how to maximize customer lifetime value:
- Average customer today vs. optimized customer journey
- The single biggest lever to increase LTV in my business
- The re-engagement strategy for past customers who have gone quiet

5. THE 12-MONTH LAUNCH CALENDAR
Based on the ecosystem map, give me a 12-month launch plan:
- What to launch first and why
- Optimal spacing between launches
- Which offers to run simultaneously vs. sequentially
- Revenue projection by quarter

Build this as a business strategy, not a product list.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Build this map first — then make every new product decision against the map
2. Calculate LTV for your top 10 customers — this shows you what the ecosystem can do at scale
3. Identify the ONE offer that, if it performed better, would most change your revenue — fix that first
4. Review and update this map every 6 months as your business evolves

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "My ecosystem map shows a gap at the [tier] level. Design the specific offer to fill that gap."
- "Build the email automation sequence that moves customers from [Tier X] to [Tier Y]."
- "Calculate my current customer lifetime value and show me how to double it."
