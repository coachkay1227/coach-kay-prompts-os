## THE PROMPT

```
You are a coaching program designer and client experience architect who has helped over 100 coaches build structured, scalable programs that deliver consistent results. You know that most coaching programs fail not because the coach lacks skill, but because the program lacks structure.

I need to design a complete coaching program — the format, the flow, the client experience, and the business model.

Here is my situation:
- The transformation I deliver through coaching: [from where to where, specifically]
- My ideal coaching client: [who they are, their situation, what they need]
- My available time per client per week: [be realistic about your hours]
- My income goal from coaching: [monthly revenue target]
- My preferred coaching style: [teaching, accountability, healing, strategy, done-with-you]

Do all of the following:

1. PROGRAM FORMAT RECOMMENDATION
Based on my situation, recommend the best format:
- 1:1 coaching (high touch, premium priced)
- Small group coaching (5-15 people, mid-high ticket)
- Large group program (15+ people, lower ticket, higher volume)
- Hybrid (self-paced curriculum + live coaching calls)
- VIP intensive (1-3 day deep dive)
Explain why this format fits my income goal, time, and transformation type.

2. COMPLETE PROGRAM STRUCTURE
Design the full program:
- Program name and tagline
- Duration and meeting frequency
- What happens in each session/phase
- Homework and implementation between sessions
- Milestones and how you measure client progress
- What clients walk away with (deliverables, tools, results)

3. CLIENT JOURNEY MAP
Map the emotional and practical journey a client takes:
- Week 1-2: Orientation, foundation-setting, quick wins
- Middle phase: Core transformation work, where it gets hard
- Final phase: Integration, celebration, what is next
Include the emotional states at each phase and how you support through them.

4. PRICING AND CAPACITY MODEL
Show me the math:
- How many clients can I realistically serve at one time?
- At what price do I hit my income goal?
- Group vs. 1:1 revenue comparison
- When and how to raise my rates as I get results

5. ONBOARDING SYSTEM
Design the first 7 days of the client experience:
- What they receive immediately after purchase
- The welcome call agenda
- What they complete before Session 1
- How you set expectations and create excitement

Design for transformation, not just sessions.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Run your first cohort at a beta price — lower price for more feedback, then raise it after proven results
2. Document every client breakthrough as a case study — this becomes your future marketing
3. Never add more content — add more implementation support. Clients need less information, more execution
4. Review and restructure every 3 cohorts based on where clients get stuck

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Write the welcome call agenda for my [program name] that sets clients up for maximum success."
- "Design a client progress tracker for my [program duration] program with weekly check-in questions."
- "Create a client agreement/contract outline for my [program name]."
