# PRODUCT SUITE DESIGN — Build a Low-Mid-High Ticket Offer Ecosystem

## Category: 02 - Offer and Product Creation | Level: INTERMEDIATE

## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

Designs a complete product ecosystem — a ladder of offers at different price points that serves buyers at every stage and maximizes revenue from every person who enters your world. Instead of one offer, you build a system where every product leads to the next.

## STANDALONE USE

Use this to: Add passive income to your existing service business, create an entry-point offer, build a client ascension path, or design your full business model from low to high ticket.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are a product ecosystem architect and revenue strategy expert who has helped online business owners build complete offer ladders that generate income at every level. You know that a single offer business is fragile — a well-designed product suite is a money engine.

I need to design my complete product suite — a strategic set of offers at different price points that all connect to each other and serve buyers at every stage.

Here is my business:
- My core expertise and transformation: [what you help people achieve]
- My current offer(s) and price(s): [what you already have or sell]
- My ideal client's journey from problem to full transformation: [the stages they go through]
- My income goal per month: [specific number]
- My available time for delivery: [hours per week you can work with clients]

Do all of the following:

1. THE COMPLETE OFFER LADDER
Design a 5-tier offer ecosystem:

Tier 1 — Free Lead Magnet ($0):
[What it is, what it teaches, and how it creates desire for the next tier]

Tier 2 — Entry Offer ($27-$197):
[Low-risk product that delivers a quick win and introduces your method]

Tier 3 — Core Offer ($497-$1,997):
[Your signature program or service — the main transformation]

Tier 4 — Premium Offer ($3,000-$10,000):
[High-touch, high-result experience for serious buyers]

Tier 5 — Continuity Offer ($47-$297/month):
[Ongoing relationship, community, or access that generates recurring revenue]

For each tier: product name, format, what is included, price, and how it connects to the next tier.

2. THE ASCENSION PATH
Map out how a single buyer can move from free to your highest offer:
- What triggers the move from Tier 1 to Tier 2?
- What triggers the move from Tier 2 to Tier 3?
- And so on up the ladder
Give me the specific email or sales trigger for each ascension point.

3. REVENUE PROJECTION
Show me the math: if [X] people enter my ecosystem per month, what does monthly revenue look like at different conversion rates through the tiers?

4. BUILD SEQUENCE
Tell me what order to build these in and why:
- What to launch first (and why)
- What to build after your first 10 sales
- What not to build until you are at $10K/month

5. THE ECOSYSTEM MAP
Describe how all tiers connect as a visual map — the flow a buyer takes through my business from first touch to lifetime client.

Be specific about product formats and realistic about conversion rates.
```

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Start with just Tiers 2 and 3 — do not try to build all five at once
2. Build in sequence as the prompt recommends — most people skip this and waste months
3. Review the Revenue Projection every 90 days and adjust the ecosystem based on what converts
4. Every new product you create should fit into one of the five tiers

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Build out a full sales page for my Tier [2/3/4] offer using the ecosystem context."
- "Write a 7-day email sequence that moves a new lead from Tier 1 (free) to Tier 2 (paid)."
- "My Tier 3 has low conversion. Based on the ecosystem design, what should I change?"
