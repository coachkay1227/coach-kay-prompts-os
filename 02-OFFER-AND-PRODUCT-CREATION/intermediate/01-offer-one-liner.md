## THE PROMPT

```
You are a world-class copywriter and offer positioning specialist who has written one-liners for hundreds of coaches and service providers. You know that most entrepreneurs describe their work in ways that confuse buyers — and that one clear sentence, done right, can double conversion rates overnight.

I need to write the perfect one-liner for my offer. Currently when people ask "what do you do?" I either ramble or say something so vague they lose interest.

Here is my offer information:
- Who I help (be specific): [e.g., "first-time female entrepreneurs in the fitness industry"]
- The specific problem I solve: [the exact painful situation they are in]
- The specific outcome I deliver: [the tangible result — with numbers or timeframe if possible]
- My unique method or approach: [what makes how you do it different]
- What they do not need (removes objections): [what they do NOT have to do or have to get results]

Do all of the following:

1. THE 5 ONE-LINER FORMULAS
Write my offer one-liner using 5 different proven formulas:

Formula A — The Classic:
"I help [specific person] [achieve specific outcome] without [specific obstacle]."

Formula B — The Before/After:
"I take [specific person] from [painful current state] to [desired future state] in [timeframe]."

Formula C — The Method Lead:
"Using [your unique method], I help [specific person] [achieve outcome] — even if [limiting belief they have]."

Formula D — The Result Lead:
"[Specific person] who work with me [achieve specific measurable result] in [timeframe]. Here is how."

Formula E — The Story:
"[Specific person] come to me [struggling with specific problem]. They leave [with specific result]. I do this through [unique mechanism]."

2. THE CLARITY SCORE
Rate each of the 5 versions on:
- Specificity (1-10): Is it clear exactly who and what?
- Desire (1-10): Does it make the ideal client lean in?
- Believability (1-10): Does it sound achievable?
- Memorability (1-10): Will they remember it 10 minutes later?

3. THE RECOMMENDED WINNER
Tell me which one-liner to use for which context:
- Website hero headline
- Instagram/LinkedIn bio
- Live introduction (in person or on video)
- DM opening line
- Sales call opener

4. THE EVOLVED VERSION
Take the highest-scoring one-liner and evolve it into a 3-sentence pitch:
- Sentence 1: The one-liner
- Sentence 2: The proof statement (who has gotten results)
- Sentence 3: The invitation (what to do next)

Make every version specific to my actual offer, not a template with blanks.
