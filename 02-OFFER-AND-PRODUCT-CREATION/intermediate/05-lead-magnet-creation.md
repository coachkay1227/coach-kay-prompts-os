## Category: 02 - Offer and Product Creation | Level: INTERMEDIATE

## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

Creates a high-converting lead magnet — a free offer so good that your ideal client immediately says "I need this" AND it pre-sells your paid offer at the same time. Most lead magnets are generic, low-value, and attract the wrong people. This prompt builds one that attracts only qualified buyers.

## STANDALONE USE

Use this to: Grow your email list, attract clients on social media, set up a content upgrade, create a freebie that leads directly to sales, or replace a weak lead magnet that is not converting.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are a lead generation strategist and conversion optimization expert who specializes in building lead magnets that do two things: attract the right people AND create immediate desire for the paid offer. You have studied what makes freebies convert — and why 90% of them fail.

I need to create a lead magnet that builds my list, attracts qualified buyers, and bridges directly to my paid offer. I am tired of free downloads that collect dust.

Here is my situation:
- My paid offer and price: [what you sell and at what price]
- My ideal client and their most urgent problem: [specific person, specific pain]
- What my ideal client is googling or asking about right now: [their search terms and questions]
- Where I will distribute this lead magnet: [social media, website, podcast, ads]
- My current list size and conversion goals: [where you are and where you want to go]

Do all of the following:

1. LEAD MAGNET CONCEPT OPTIONS
Generate 5 lead magnet concepts that fit my audience and bridge to my paid offer. For each:
- Format: (checklist, guide, video training, challenge, quiz, template, email course)
- Title: (specific, benefit-driven, creates urgency)
- The "quick win" it delivers in under 15 minutes
- Why someone who finishes this would WANT to buy my paid offer
- Estimated opt-in rate potential (low/medium/high) and why

2. THE WINNING CONCEPT
Pick the strongest option and fully develop it:
- Exact title and subtitle
- Complete outline (sections, key points, action steps)
- The "bridge moment" — the specific point where the freebie naturally leads to the paid offer
- Delivery format and technical setup recommendation

3. THE OPT-IN PAGE COPY
Write the complete opt-in page copy:
- Headline (specific, benefit-driven)
- Subheadline (clarifies who it is for and what they get)
- 3-5 bullet points of specific benefits
- Call to action button text
- Trust element (what to say to reduce sign-up friction)

4. THE THANK YOU PAGE STRATEGY
Design the page they see after opting in:
- What to say first (confirm + set expectations)
- The immediate upsell or bridge to paid offer
- The exact CTA that gets 5-15% to buy immediately after opting in

5. THE PROMOTION PLAN
Give me a 7-day plan to get my first 100 opt-ins with no ad budget:
- Specific platforms and posting strategy
- DM strategy to invite ideal clients
- Partnership or collaboration angles
- Repurposing the lead magnet for maximum reach

Build it to qualify buyers, not just collect emails.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Choose a lead magnet that delivers a "quick win" in under 15 minutes — complexity kills opt-in rates
2. Put your lead magnet on every platform simultaneously on launch day
3. Track opt-in rate and quality of leads (do they buy?) — not just list growth
4. Update or replace a lead magnet that is not converting to buyers after 90 days

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Write the full content for my [lead magnet title] guide/checklist/template."
- "Create a 5-email welcome sequence that delivers value and pitches my [paid offer] by email 4."
- "Redesign my opt-in page — here is the current copy: [paste it]. What is weak and how do I fix it?"
