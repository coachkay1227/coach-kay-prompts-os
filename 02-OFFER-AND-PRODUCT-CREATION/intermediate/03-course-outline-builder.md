# COURSE OUTLINE BUILDER — Create a Complete Course Structure That Delivers Results

## Category: 02 - Offer and Product Creation | Level: INTERMEDIATE

## WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES

Builds a complete, results-driven online course structure from scratch — with the right number of modules, a logical learning sequence, transformational lesson content, and built-in student success milestones. Most courses fail not because of bad content, but bad architecture. This fixes that.

## STANDALONE USE

Use this to: Build your first course, restructure an existing course that is not getting results, design a group program curriculum, or create a self-paced learning experience.

## THE PROMPT

```
You are an instructional designer and online course architect with 10 years of experience building courses that get real student results. You know that the difference between a forgettable course and a transformational one is structure, sequencing, and psychology — not content volume.

I need to build a complete course outline that is designed for results, not just information delivery.

Here is my course concept:
- The transformation my course delivers: [from where to where — be specific about before and after]
- My ideal student and their starting knowledge level: [who they are and what they already know]
- The timeline students will experience: [e.g., 6-week program, 90-day course, self-paced]
- The format I am planning: [video lessons, live calls, workbooks, community, etc.]
- What I know students need to believe by the end: [the mindset shift required to get results]

Do all of the following:

1. COURSE ARCHITECTURE
Design the complete course structure:
- Course name (3 options, benefit-led)
- Course promise (the specific transformation in one sentence)
- Number of modules and overall flow
- The "learning arc" — how does a student's mindset and skill level shift from Module 1 to the final module?

2. FULL MODULE BREAKDOWN
For each module:
- Module name (outcome-focused, not topic-focused)
- Module goal: what students can DO after this module
- 3-5 lessons with names and key learning points
- One practical exercise or implementation activity
- One "milestone moment" — a specific win that proves progress

3. THE TRANSFORMATION SEQUENCE
Show me the psychological journey a student takes through the course:
- What must they believe at the start of each module?
- What must they believe by the end?
- What is the biggest mindset obstacle in each module and how do you address it?

4. STUDENT SUCCESS SYSTEM
Design the accountability and success infrastructure:
- When and how to check student progress
- Warning signs a student is falling behind and how to intervene
- The "graduation" criteria — what does a successful completion look like?

5. COURSE DELIVERY ROADMAP
Give me a 30-day build plan to create all course materials — what to make first, what tools to use, and how to record, design, and host it.

Prioritize results over volume. A course with 4 great modules beats 12 mediocre ones.

## HOW TO USE THIS PROMPT

1. Write the transformation FIRST — every module should serve that specific transformation
2. Test your outline by having 3 ideal students react to it before building anything
3. Build Module 1 first and test it with beta students — get feedback before completing the rest
4. "Done" does not mean perfect — done means delivering the promised transformation

## ITERATION PROMPTS (Run After)

- "Write the complete script for Lesson [number] of Module [number]: [lesson name]."
- "Create the workbook exercises for Module [number] that help students implement [specific skill]."
- "Design the onboarding experience for new students — the first 48 hours after they enroll."
